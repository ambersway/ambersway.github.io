	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Amber, I remember every time I came over, we would laugh and play for hours and you would always tell me to play with you more than the others. and when I did, we were both really happy. I am glad I played with you. You are strong and in my prayers. We love you! &#060;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amber, I have followed all of these posts since the beginning. I met you only once in Walmart with your beautiful amazing Mom. I immediately loved your spunk and spirit. It stuck with me. You are simply awesome. 
I admire you and am in awe of your miracle. I work with youth and kids in our church and speak of you often. We will keep praying for you and Mom and Dad and your family. My family will keep praying too. We are all so proud of you. Love you cutie pie.. May God keep shining through you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amber, when my daughter just 3 or 4 years old she would share with me that she saw my mom, who had passed, in Heaven. When  I asked her what it was that she saw, she replied &quot;it is so beautiful there and peaceful, lots of green grass and flowers with all of those that have gone before us&quot;.
God bless you little angel.
