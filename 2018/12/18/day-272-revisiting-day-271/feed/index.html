	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt and Caron, We heard of Amber through her school friend Jeanie who has been praying with, and for Amber. Yours and her story is hard and beautiful. Amber exemplified the Faith that we&#039;d like to see adults hold as close as she did. A good and Godly family is the best foundation for this in a child&#039;s life&#062; You&#039;ve done well.

We&#039;re so sorry for your loss, and pray the knowledge of Who she is with, will encourage you now and always.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so sorry, Matt. Nobody, ever, for any reason, should have to endure the loss of a child. This is a heartbreaking time. It&#039;s natural that you feel broken and exhausted; how could it be otherwise? I know that the grief you all feel will, someday, slowly, diminish and you will be better able to celebrate Amber&#039;s life. I was thinking yesterday that we often use the term &quot;a life well lived&quot; for the older friends and family that we lose. Amber truly had a life well lived; she was here too briefly but her sass and determination and sweetness touched and inspired countless people. Amber is unforgettable and she leaves a wonderful legacy of inspiration. As you have so selflessly cared for Amber all these months, I hope you and Caron will now care for yourselves and each other. Take time to grieve, reflect and heal. You are all in my thoughts and prayers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can not put into words the sorrow and heartache I feel for your family. Knowing that Amber is no longer enduring her disease and that is now an angel watching over us does bring some calm to the storm. I hope this prayer brings you and your family some comfort. 

Father, I pray for the Smith Family and others in my circle of family and friends who are grieving...

They&#039;re hurting for many reasons, and I ask You to help them through this season of loss. I reach out to You, the Father of compassion and the Source of every comfort, asking You to touch them with Your unfailing love and kindness. Be their God who comforts them as they&#039;re going through their struggles, and bring them through the tough things ahead. Come alongside them in their pain, and strengthen them so they&#039;ll one day be able to help others who face the same struggles. (2 Corinthians 1:3–4; Psalm 33:22; 1 Samuel 20:14a)]]></description>
