	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt and Caron,
Once again, my heart goes out to you as well as to Marie, Brianna, and Ryan.  There is nothing worse than losing a child.  Yet, with all that you are going through,  you came to school to bring gifts to the staff here at school!!!  Your children are our gifts!!  It is obvious that you taught them to always have a giving heart!  Amber never thought of herself - always others.  She is  a little angel and I will always hold her dear to my heart!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is no words for what you both are going through. I want to offer my deepest sympathy on the loss of your beautiful angel Amber. I am sorry you both had to experience this in your life. Amber was blessed to have you have loving parents as you were blessed to have Amber in your life, along with your other children.
Thinking of you all and will be praying for you today and always.
