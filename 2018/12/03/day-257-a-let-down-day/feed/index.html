	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Caron and Matt,
I realize that this is such disappointing news for you. You  and Amber certainly have traveled on a very difficult journey.  I can only imagine how difficult this is for any parent, especially you.  Please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers daily.
