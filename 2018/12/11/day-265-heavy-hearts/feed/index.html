	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I are praying for the entire family and especially for Amber-such a wonderful child who for the past year always had a loud &quot;Hello Mr. Costello&quot; for me whenever I was in school. I feel blessed to have had any interaction with her-as would anyone else!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am completely heartbroken. Your family is in my prayers. I pray for Amber to be comfortable and happy and for you ALL to find peace in this crazy, ridiculous, incomprehensible situation. There are just no words to adequately convey what I’d like to say to you.]]></description>
