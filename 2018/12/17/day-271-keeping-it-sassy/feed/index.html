	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Each moment a gift,
that‚Äôs blessed  from above.
These memories we cherish,
with hearts full of love.

We thank you our Lord,
for the time that you give,
for this precious young life,
with a desire to live.

I pray for your will,
whatever will be,
for healing for Amber,
and setting her free.

***
I continue to be in awe of your strength. You are in my prayers Amber! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="üíú" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> t

p.s. We have a few things in common; we are both nieces to Uncle Jim and Aunt Diane, we love to dance and we love Jesus! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="üíú" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/271d.png" alt="‚úù" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amber: you are incredibly strong and incredibly brave - a true supergirl, and you have a beautiful spirit. We have constantly been in awe of how hard you work and how you handle every challenge with grace and of course, sass. 

Caron, Matt and family, you also are incredibly strong and the love that you have for each other and that you share with everyone you come in contact with is amazing. Please know that we are all thinking of you, praying for you, and are here if you need anything. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
