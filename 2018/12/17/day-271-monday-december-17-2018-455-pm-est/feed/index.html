	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, Caron and all of your family, I am truly heartbroken for all of you. I have been following your journey and you both have incredible faith and strength. I prayed for Amber every day and was hoping she could get through the holidays. This was not meant to be. I will continue to pray for Amber God&#039;s little angel and all of you. You should consider publishing this blog someday as I think it would help other family&#039;s who also should never have to go through this. I am so happy that you can see the blessings in all of this and hope and pray that it will bring you peace. Amber is now home with our heavenly father and will sing, eat marshmallows and be waiting for all of you in paradise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My heart cries for Amber and her family tonight.  What an angelic face and now a very sorrowful loss.  She looks a lot like my niece who passed away some time ago.  Maybe they will be friends in Heaven and can watch over all of us and laugh...  and eat marshmallows.  My sympathies.]]></description>
