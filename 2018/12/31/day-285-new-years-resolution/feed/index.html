	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your writing and the example your family set for how to demonstrate compassion and Grace in the midst of challenge and heartache was and continues to be inspiring.  I will look for ways to reach out to others to offer support and comfort, and I will think of your family and Amber as I do so.  Sending you prayers for strength in the days ahead.  May you find sources of comfort in your grief as you have so aptly given it to others.  
Blessings,
Kelly Shaw]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt and Caron:

Your thoughtful and beautiful writings on your blog have been a tangible and powerful witness to the reality of unconditional love and to a wisdom born of suffering. Your transparency was a wonderful gift that you shared with everyone.  You connected us with the deepest part of our common humanity- evoking such emotions and experiences as sadness/joy, fear/hope, control/surrender - demonstrating that they are mysteriously intertwined and not meant to be separated. 

Your invitation to us to be aware of and to intentionally &quot;reach out&quot; to the suffering and lonely souls in our midst is both challenging and inspiring. Your understanding that love is meant to move outward, not to be stagnant or closed in on itself, is instructive to all of us. 

You have opened our hearts and eyes to the core of the Christian message and I am so grateful to both of you for sharing Amber&#039;s and your family&#039;s journey.

May God Bless You all.

					<description><![CDATA[Matt and Caron,
Your blog has been a blessing for all of us.  Amber was always looking out for someone else, and never complained about what she was going through.  It is obvious that you,her parents, were such role models for her in this and in so many different ways. That is the legacy that she leaves us.   She has touched so many people as was evident in the wake and the funeral, as well as in the many posts in your blog.  You shared your heartbreak with us, but you also coupled it with your faith.  You are one beautiful  and amazing family!   Although the days ahead will be difficult, please know that you are in the thoughts and prayers of so many people whom you have inspired.  May God give you the comfort and peace that you so deserve.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is absolutely Amber’s legacy that we all show each other more kindness and try to be aware that everyone has a story and anyone around us may be struggling at any given time. Wishing your family peace; I will always think fondly of Amber and she will inspire me to do better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Matt and Caron For being such a blessing and a grace to so many of us by the way you have lived your life in the year 2018.
