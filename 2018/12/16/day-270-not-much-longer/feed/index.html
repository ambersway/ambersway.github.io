	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are sending Amber off to heaven with love, in her own home, surrounded by family.  What a beautiful gift you are giving her.  We are sending our prayers; it&#039;s a sacred role to be the ones to support the transition from this life to the next.  (I felt it with supporting my parents and I know you are feeling it too - the sorrow and the Grace.)  Many prayers to you during this time.  Hold onto all the love you see flowing your way from those of us who admire you &#038; Amber, and your family&#039;s journey.  Prayers and love from NC.]]></description>
