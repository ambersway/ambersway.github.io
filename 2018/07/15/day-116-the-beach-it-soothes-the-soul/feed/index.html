	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[So happy that your family had such a wonderful (MUCH deserved!!) vacation at one of the most beautiful places in the world! I think of Amber often, hoping she is continuing her super-progress and that she is happy and just enjoying being a kid during the summer. Every good wish, prayer, and ‚Äúfingers crossed‚Äù for the upcoming MRI to be clean‚Ä¶]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the update, Caron. Yes, there is certainly a healing factor in the beach and the waters that surround it. God was certainly doing His best work on the day those were created. Prayers for you all have been continuing since we found out about Amber&#8217;s journey. We are putting out the word for a blanket of prayer, especially focusing on 7.25. Sending you all much love and strength!
