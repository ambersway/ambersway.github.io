	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt and Caron, I do not have the words to adequately express my feelings.  Just know that your family is in my thoughts and prayers.
Caron, although we have not met I want you to know how much I admire and respect your husband.  It has been truly a great pleasure working with and getting to know Matt over the past 2 years.
Matt, I know you know this &#8212; the words here demonstrate how strong, caring, and intelligent your wife  is.  Your family&#8217;s love for one another and incredible bond is evident.
My wish is that you continue to find hope and progress and that your faith and love carry you through this difficult ordeal.
Prayers for you all,
Mark Tonneson
