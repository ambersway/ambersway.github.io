	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[We HOPE &#038; Pray for Amber and all of your family who have been going through so much. Have they spoken about a central line at all rather then the IV sticks over &#038; over again? After a couple years of my hospital stay they had to put one in do to the antibiotics closing down everything to stick a needle into and it did make it a LOT easier on me and everyone else.  Take care, we think of you so often!

					<description><![CDATA[We will also be praying extra hard for Amber and you this week.
Why don&#8217;t the doctors install a port so that inserting the IVs is easier and less painful?
