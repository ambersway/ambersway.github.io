	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[This Sunday, my Pastor preached about being Easter people in a Good Friday world, and to look for Easter moments, no matter how small.
Amber‚Äôs progress is a prime example for me of these ‚ÄúEaster moments‚Äù.  It brings me great joy to read about her progress each day.
You all continue to be in my prayers.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for these updates, Matt. This is all encouraging news. What an amazing little girl Amber is!
As Amber progresses, I would encourage you to inquire about pet therapy that may be available at CCMC. Lots of research shows so many beneficial effects and I‚Äôll bet she‚Äôd love to feel a furry head and a wet nose!]]></description>
