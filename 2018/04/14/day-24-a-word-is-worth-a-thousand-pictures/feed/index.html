	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love reading your blog about Amber and the incredible strength you show us. You are experiencing  such heartache as her parents. She is really a super little girl and has come so far.  The love she has around her will help you all moving forward. Prayers for continued strength.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi guys,
  We can not even begin to imagine what everyone has been going through, especially for Amber. I am up that way 3 to 4 days a week at UCONN for my medical issues so if anyone should need a ride or something transported to, from the hospital please give us a call. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of you.]]></description>
