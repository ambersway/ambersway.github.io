	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I haven&#8217;t commented until now but I&#8217;ve been following Amber&#8217;s story and I am thankful that you give the updates that you give.  For you to consider other people&#8217;s concern during a time like this is a testimant to what good people you are.   
My name is Kathi and I don&#8217;t know you but my best friends daughter Sadie dances with Amber at Luis Pabon.  I wanted to write because Sadies mom Angela had called and told me about Amber and wanted to know if I could give her a Snuggles From Sassy for her to give to Amber.  I was thrilled to do it!  My mom was a professional clown in Florida &#8211; Sassy &#8211; and she LOVED working with all kids but particularly sick kids.  So in her memory I started making mini security blankets called Snuggles From Sassy.  
What I wanted to share with you was that I was excited that the first blanket I donated was to Amber!  I &#8220;talked&#8221; to my mom before I sent it out the door and told her I knew she would be thrilled with it and I asked her to be an angel in heaven for Amber and watch over her and help her get through this.  I am not a religious person but I am spiritual and I do believe in praying to whoever your higher power is and I believe it can help.  So know that there are people who don&#8217;t know you or Amber and they are praying for your little girls recovery and health.  I also pray for your continued strength to get through, what I can only imagaine as I have never experienced, what must be the hardest test of your life.  Thinking of you all wishing health and peace!

					<description><![CDATA[I am thrilled to hear that Amber is out of ICU!!  One small miracle at a time!  Our prayers continue for Amber and you!  We at school  are praying daily for Amber.  Mr. Fiore, our Diocesan Superintendent, came to visit our school today, and also prayed for Amber.  We look forward to hearing more great news like this.

God bless you!

					<description><![CDATA[Great news Matt! You and Caron are wonderful parents and your faith is your love for your children and each other. You may ask why these tests of faith and why has this happened, but I guess these are some of life‚Äôs mysteries.
P.S. I  asked for prayers for Amber last night from the membership at our Council 1090 Knights of Columbus meeting. A lot of prayer warriors are on your side.]]></description>
