	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[As I read this my heart breaks even more..,, and I even almost started to cry, just like her I can not wait for her to be home. So we don&#8217;t have to go to the hospital every weekend. I like to,  but I want her home to. So we can ALL be together again. So we do not have to be apart, even though we video chat

					<description><![CDATA[It is always hard for parents to see their children suffer.  I can&#8217;t even imagine what it must be like!  Your love for Amber and the  strength that you and Matt have together is very comforting in this very trying time in your lives.  Please know that you are in my prayers daily.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh&#8230;..sweet Mama Caron. You are an incredible Mama. You are so strong. You have such power in you. Your heart is allowed to break. It&#8217;s not right. It is NOT fair!!! But you put on that smile and that laugh and you do it BECAUSE you are a Mama. Just not any Mama&#8230;..but Amber&#8217;s. God, how I wish I could take it all away for you!!! Yes, Thank You God that he gave you a wonderful partner like Matt. Lean on him, cry on him. You are allowed&#8230;.so allowed. And in the end the only thing Amber needs is her Mama smiling even though you are so broken inside. Like I told you before: YOU are her Wonder women, Caron! I love you so much!!!!

					<description><![CDATA[We are so sorry you are all going through such a tough time. But you do it with such grace, even when it is incredibly hard to see Amber dealing with it all.
We will say extra prayers for you today, Caron.
Isn&#8217;t it Fr. Tito that says that the depth of your suffering shows the depth of your love? Your love is very real and beautiful.
Together you will make it through, we are sure of it!
