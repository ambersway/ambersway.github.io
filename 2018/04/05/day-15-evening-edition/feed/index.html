	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
  My God, We are so very sorry to learn of Amber‚Äôs medical issues that have come up and so sad that I have been offline for so long to not have known sooner in case there was anything at all that we could do to help out in anyway whatsoever. I am up that way several times a week for all of my doctors appointments, if anyone needs anything brought up, a ride to or from teh hospital, dinner made for anyone, etc PLEASE by all means just contact us. Our thoughts &#038; prayers go out to all of your family  but twice as much to Amber. Please know that so many are thinking of all of you and no matter what time of day or night, just call and we will be there! Take care, please tell Amber that we are thinking about her.]]></description>
