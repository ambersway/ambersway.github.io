	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[YES, give her as much nutrients as can. She&#8217;ll gulp it. Her body is craving it. That&#8217;s what happened to me. Also her body is naturally healing so that&#8217;s why so irritable with the G-tube. I think this that&#8217;s she, Amber, WON&#8221;T have to go through those next stages of chemo. That God is delivering her now as we speak. Lets all believe this. Pull down the Faith in all of this to overcome this Disease in Jesus Name, Amen
