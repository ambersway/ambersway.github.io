	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prayers for your Amber&#8230;..Prayers for your family&#8230;..Thank you for your blog, it helps me so much&#8230;.
My son, who turned 34 on April 11th was diagnosed on January 31st&#8230;.We are a bit ahead in the game, but as I read Amber’s story, I relate in so many ways&#8230;.All the feelings as a parent, yup, they are all the same&#8230;.I’m stuck on the “Why my Justin” piece&#8230;I’m working on that with some outside help, but it is tough&#8230;.
Also seeing the courage &#038; dedication &#038; willingness to do the hard work in my guy just makes me so stinking proud of him &#038; so very sad all at the same time&#8230;.
He lives in Maine, but had his surgeries and treatments at Mass General&#8230;He completed 30 radiation treatments &#038; 40 Chemo, (by pill) on April 6&#8230;..In May he has the all telling MRI, before the next phase begins&#8230;.He &#038; his wife are living in Mass temporarily so treatments can continue through Mass General
I’m not one to comment on blogs, but I felt I needed to reach out&#8230;
I try to find the positives in this heartbreaking situation, and I do&#8230;.I’ve seen many small miracles happen in the past few months.  I believe all the small miracles will add up to one very big miracle&#8230;.Actually, two&#8230;.One for my Justin &#038; one for your Amber&#8230;.
Blessings to you and your family
