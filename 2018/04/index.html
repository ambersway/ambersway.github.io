We're going to make this journey in Amber's Way &ndash; with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</h2>

		<p>We started our day around 6:30 AM, with final prep for the MRI, and our trip to radiology on the first floor for 7:30. Amber was asleep (sedated) for the scan. Everything went smoothly, and we were back in the room by 10.</p>
<p>Now, we wait for results. We are bracing ourselves, though we are not quite sure what we are bracing for. We already know we are facing a very serious, very aggressive brain cancer. We already know that a tumor grew and burst, causing the stroke we have been recovering from for 40 days. We know that Amber goes into surgery on Thursday to have the skull flap re-inserted, and that if there is any regrowth of the original tumor, it will be extracted at that time. And we know that we are going to start going on the attack against the cancer in a few weeks, with all the energy and Faith we have. But still, we brace ourselves for the possibility of new information, of some new direction or impact.</p>
<p>On a lighter note though &ndash; Amber&rsquo;s physical recovery continues to improve, and today we got her new leg brace! This brace will help support her weight on her left leg while we continue to build up its strength, so she can begin walking sooner. And check out the design she picked out:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-357" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/signal-2018-04-30-2011272944859534021307549.jpg" width="1701" height="2763"></p>
<p>Just as this brace will help hold up Amber&rsquo;s body, we pray that God will hold up Amber&rsquo;s spirit, and will give us the strength to hold up Amber through this whole journey.</p>

		<p>Amber and I had a low key day. We watched some Minecraft videos, I cut the huge mat out of her hair, I painted her nails and she painted mine, we took a field trip around Floor 8, tried to play XBox Football in the playroom (that was hilarious), read a couple pages of Superkids (as we snuggled in her bed), and then watched more Minecraft videos (yay). Very relaxing and uneventful, which is nice given what&rsquo;s coming up in the week ahead.</p>
<p>However, there was something extra meaningful later on this evening. At 7PM, Amber and I were praying extra hard. We knew at this moment, and for the next hour, there was something very special happening &mdash; St. Mary&rsquo;s Church in Baltic, our Church, was having an hour-long prayer service in honor of her, and because of that we wanted to make sure we prayed right along with everyone else.</p>
<hr>
<p><i>(Added by Matt) </i></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At 7:00 tonight, the kids and I attended the prayer service at St Mary&rsquo;s in Baltic. It was a simple, peaceful hour of music and quiet prayer. But it was powerful, and overwhelming for me to see all the support. Thank you to everyone who attended, participated, and prayed with us.</p>
<p>When I returned to the hospital to be with Amber for the night, the nurses were working to put in an IV. Sadly, Amber&rsquo;s poor veins have been through a lot over that past 6 weeks and didn&rsquo;t want to cooperate. It took several very painful attempts, before having to give up and agree to use a gas sedative tomorrow morning and install the IV then. Watching Amber cry in pain was heart wrenching, knowing that I cannot take this pain for her really tears me up inside.</p>
<p>Caron pointed something out to me tonight. Tomorrow is day 40. This has been 40 days of suffering for Amber. I don&rsquo;t know if I should draw deeper meaning from this, but I felt it was worth noting anyway.</p>
<p>So now we look to tomorrow&rsquo;s MRI scan. The scan doesn&rsquo;t change anything, it doesn&rsquo;t change our risks. It just reveals what is already reality. We will get the results on Tuesday. So tonight, we pray for the strength to accept whatever the MRI shows, we pray that God grant Amber a path to health, and we pray that God grant Amber peace and comfort during this journey.</p>

		<p>The weekends tend to be a bit quieter for Amber and for the hospital in general. A little PT with a fill-in for Ms. Lauren named Ms. Heather, a student nurse from Quinnipiac named Catherine (which was easy to remember since that&rsquo;s Amber&rsquo;s best friend&rsquo;s name) hung out with us, and a lovely field trip outside, was basically the schedule of the day.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I love Saturdays, is because it&rsquo;s Church day. I have grown to love our little routine of getting out to Mass while Amber is cared for by a family member. This Saturday though, Matt was back home with the kiddos so I asked my parents, a.k.a. Mem and Pep (to their grandchildren), if they would like to come hang out. Pep offered to gladly stay with Amber while Mem and I enjoyed the beautiful weather during our 10 minute walk to Father Charlie&rsquo;s Church, Holy Trinity Mission Church.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed going to church, but lately it means so much more. It&rsquo;s the spiritual <i>need</i> to go. My soul just feels so good, so cleansed and refreshed. Under the recent circumstances, there&rsquo;s been a sort of spiritual shift, a deepening with my relationship with God, Mary, and Jesus. They&rsquo;ve done so much and I look forward to officially &ldquo;thanking them&rdquo; at Mass each week.</p>
<p>There were a few things that stood out to me at Mass this evening:</p>
<p>When I opened up the missilet to where they placed the weekly bulletin, the front page made me ponder a bit. Right there, with a beautiful picture of a field during sunrise (or sunset), was the title: <b>5th Sunday of Easter</b>, which made me think of Amber&rsquo;s 5th Sunday in the hospital. After everything Jesus went through to get to his peace, I can only pray that Amber finds her peace as well.</p>
<p>Father Charlie was telling us about an interview with a woman on the news recently. When the reporter asked her what she thought about the convicted killer that went to jail, her response was clever, witty, and meaningful, she said &ldquo;I am too blessed to be stressed&rdquo;. For most of us, that is so true. But there are people, take Hartford for instance, that don&rsquo;t have shelter, or food or clothing and that aren&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;. Yes, Matt and I are going through a rough patch with Amber&rsquo;s health but ultimately, we are blessed. Blessed to have the means to be with Amber during this terrible time; great support systems that help us with the other children, great co-workers that help take the load off Matt, great hospital care to help Amber thrive, great insurance to help offset the cost, great family friends and aquaintences to help pray for Amber &mdash; and the list just keeps going. At times life right now feels out of control, but it could be a lot worse. All we have to do is look around and realize, we&rsquo;re too blessed to be stressed.</p>
<p>During Mass, when saying the prayers, I looked down in the pew in front of me and saw that the woman left her book opened to the song that would be sung in a few minutes. I read the title, and again pondered its words: &lsquo;Be Not Afraid&rsquo;. A beautiful song that I always look forward to hearing my daughter Brianna sing in her choir at school and our Church. The words struck me as more meaningful this evening though, more like an answer to my growing intrepidation of the next few days&rsquo; worth of fears . . . &lsquo;<i>Be Not Afraid</i>&lsquo; &mdash; &lsquo;<i>I am with you through it all&rsquo; . . .</i></p>

		<p>When we first arrived at CCMC, a very long 37 days ago, I noticed an informational video looping repeatedly on a TV screen in the hallway, with a short segment showing many of the staff wearing superhero shirts or costumes. During the next week, I remember hearing about &ldquo;Superhero Day&rdquo;, and how it was coming on April 27. At the time, a few days into our journey, I remember having two conflicting reactions to this &ndash; one reaction stemming from my difficulty in accepting this surreal set of events, not believing that we could possibly still be here by the time April 27 arrives; the other stemming from the deep despair of the moment, worried that we may not still be here by April 27.</p>
<p>Well, we were definitely here today, and Amber fit right in among the Superheroes!!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-335" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180427_114025-e1524883278961.jpg" alt="Superhero Day" width="3169" height="2600"></p>
<p>Superhero Day is a special day at CCMC. As <a href="https://www.connecticutchildrens.org/child-family-support-services/superhero-day/">their site puts it</a>,&rdquo;In honor of National Superhero Day, caped crusaders took a break from fighting crime to visit with our patients who are fighting battles of their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amber is fighting a battle, fighting it hard. Today, PT brought a walker for her to try standing with. They helped her climb out of bed and grab onto it, and encouraged her to try to take a few steps. With them supporting her torso, and helping direct her left foot, she started pushing the walker forward, taking a few steps. And then a few more. Next thing we know, she is leading the way out the door of her room, into the hallway, and across to the nurses station, dragging the two therapists along with her! By the time she makes it back, a total trip of about 40-50 feet, she is exhausted and needs help climbing back into bed &ndash; but, she did it, and was proud of herself (almost as proud of herself as her Mom and Dad were of her!). Yes, she needed a lot of help from the therapists, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. She has the determination, and the motivation, to work real hard at this. And, over time, if we can maintain this momentum and the positive attitude, she will be more and more self-sufficient, and defeat both this evil villain and the next.</p>
<p>When I look back 37 days, and re-read some of our <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/03/27/amber-update-day-6-early-edition/">earliest posts to this blog</a>, I am truly amazed at the distance we&rsquo;ve already come. We have avoided posting pictures of Amber during this time &ndash; but feel it appropriate now, to contrast our current state against where we were at the beginning. Here is a link to a picture from March 22, hours after her first surgery. I am including this as a link, instead of putting the full picture right here, as some may find the image alarming, or at least may not wish to show it to children &ndash; it is of Amber lying in bed in a hospital gown, bandaged and hooked to many machines.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/amber20180322.jpg">/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/amber20180322.jpg</a></p>
<p>Next week is a big week. Monday we have an MRI, and are expecting to receive the results on Tuesday. This MRI is checking on the recovery of the brain, and looking for any tumor regrowth. Then on Thursday, we go into surgery &ndash; first removing any bits of tumor that have returned, then replacing the piece of skull that was removed on March 22.</p>
<p>In preparation for this big week, we ask for continued prayer for Amber, that she continues to be strong in her determination, motivation, and Faith (these are her superhero powers!); we pray that it is within God&rsquo;s will to grant us a miracle, no matter how big or small, toward Amber&rsquo;s recovery; we pray that God continue to provide strength and clarity to the medical professionals providing for Amber&rsquo;s care; and we pray for the strength to accept God&rsquo;s will, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>And we thank our friends for organizing a special prayer service for Amber, this Sunday night at 7 PM, at <a href="http://stmarybaltic.com/contact.html">our Church</a>, St. Mary&rsquo;s in Baltic CT. If you cannot attend in person, we invite you to join us in prayer at this time, wherever you may be located.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much stronger than you think you are. Trust me.&rdquo; (<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>All-Star Superman</i></span>) Amber is proving this true, both about herself, and about us, every step of this journey.</p>

		<p>Apparently, for Amber, standing just wasn&rsquo;t good enough. She told Ms. Lauren and Ms. Caitlin at PT/OT today that she wanted to walk, and walk, she did.</p>
<p>Amber was sitting in her wheelchair, Ms. Lauren in front of her and Ms. Caitlin on the side of her. With all the practice yesterday, Amber was able to go from sitting to standing; almost with ease. With Ms. Lauren instructing her, she takes a step with her good foot, her right foot. Next is harder, but Amber is determined, and with some aid from Ms. Lauren, she brings that sleepy left leg and foot forward and takes a step. Then her right. Then her left . . . <b>tiny but mighty.</b> As Amber takes these steps, you can see the strength, the purpose, of all this hard work. She knows that if she continues to get strong, she can get out of this hospital and finally go home. Amber walked about 3 feet to her end destination, me, where I was kissing and praising her like only a proud Mama could do! Later on, she walked even further, with her end destination being her bed and by that point she was clearly exhausted &mdash; but not too exhausted because she was able to muster that last bit of energy to crawl into bed!</p>
<p>Tomorrow is a big day for CCMC. It&rsquo;s the annual <a href="https://www.connecticutchildrens.org/child-family-support-services/superhero-day/">Superhero Day</a> ! However, I believe that Superhero Day came a bit early. I believe we just saw a Superhero at her finest, today . . . and honestly, almost every day now, there&rsquo;s been something worth celebrating by this Supergirl!</p>

		<p>Oatmeal and spinach are great, but &hellip; sometimes you just need a little bacon! Amber started the day with Speech Therapy bringing in some new breakfast items &ndash; things that are harder to chew and swallow, to see if Amber is ready for a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; menu. Waffles, whole strawberries, and &hellip; bacon! The bacon was a little tough, but Amber gnawed her way through. Following the successful breakfast test, Amber&rsquo;s menu has been upgraded; she now can order hotdogs and hamburgers, carrot and celery sticks, chicken nuggets. She still needs to eat slowly and carefully, but it&rsquo;s nice to have her eating pretty much back to normal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Amber has caught a bit of a cold along the way though. Lots of sniffling and coughing, enough to upset her stomach. So, breakfast didn&rsquo;t stay in her stomach very long. But, the other meals stayed down, and she is doing well.</p>
<p>Then, as usual, on to OT and PT. Man, I wish I had Amber&rsquo;s perseverance when it comes to exercise. An hour on the swings working her arms and balance, and an hour kneeling and standing, kicking her new rainbow-colored kickball.</p>
<p>We are just a handful of days away from the next big milestones &ndash; Monday is the MRI to see how the brain is doing and determine if there is any primary tumor regrowth (we won&rsquo;t get the results until Tuesday, though), and Thursday (May 3) is the surgery to replace the skull flap. And then, we begin <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/03/day-13-the-elephant-and-the-whale/">eating the whale</a> shortly after.</p>
<p>But hopefully, with a little more perseverance over the next 2 weeks, we&rsquo;ll have enough of the elephant eaten that we can come home before we tackle that whale. I think that&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;ll need to renew Amber&rsquo;s appetite, and re-energize all of our spirits.</p>

		<p>After a bit of a rough start to the morning &mdash; Amber threw her breakfast and supplemental feed up (her sibs shared some type of coughing/mucus germ) . . . She persevered. PT with Lauren and crew showed us just how bad Amber wants out of here. Not only did she kneel in a high kneel position (and at some points unsupported), she STOOD UP to stand against her bed with Lauren and Shannon supporting her! Yes, stood up and stayed that way for a few minutes!!! After that, after all that hard work, she literally crawled up into bed!!!</p>
<p>* SUPER AMBER GRACE!!!! *</p>
<p>Once situated back in bed, Amber had a lovely visit from a Volunteer named Michelle and her 14 year young dog named Carina. Carina got in bed with Amber and Amber was in her glory!</p>
<p>After some lunch of mac and cheese and spinach (still on a spinach kick &mdash; getting strong from it (and it&rsquo;s obviously working!)), and bit of chocolate munchkin for dessert, it was time to go outside for some Vitamin D.</p>
<p>Little miracles and blessings everyday. Thank you God, Mary, and Jesus &mdash; Amber&rsquo;s strength is heightened by you. And thanks to you; our families, friends, aquaintences, and even kind folks that don&rsquo;t even know us (officially anyway) &mdash; your prayers and positive thoughts . . . we feel them! Our love to you all! &#128156;</p>

		<hr>
<p><i><i><i><i></i></i></i></i><i><i><i><i></i></i></i></i></p>
<p>Today was a busy day. After attempting some (almost) 5 week old homework, Amber had a small speech therapy with a fill-in for Sara named Kiersten during breakfast.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Catie came in and removed the remaining stitches and staples.</p>
<p>We had PT down on Floor 5, and were able to see Amber swing. When she was sitting there she had her feet on the floor and was swinging the swing on her own, even her left leg and foot were helping a little! Then we got on the floor in a high kneel and pushed and pulled a big ball back and forth 5 times!</p>
<p>After that we had a nice visit with Grammy and Grammy back at her room. They brought up the Relic of the True Cross from Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral where we said a couple beautiful prayers with Amber before her lunch. During the prayers, while Amber was in the wheelchair, I noticed she was struggling with her right hand to get her left arm and hand on to the top of her tray. I went over and helped place her left arm and hand there for her. I was thinking she was uncomfortable with it being on her lap, but no, that&rsquo;s not what it was. As soon as I did that for her, she promptly takes her right hand and feeds those fingers through the non-responsive left fingers so that she could properly pray (out loud) those prayers with folded hands. That &mdash; that was tough. I choked out the last of the prayers and went to the opposite corner of the room to cry and try to put myself back together. Remember my post from a couple days ago about her. . .<i> innocence and sweetness,</i> yeah, same exact feeling going through me again. These moments are tremendously pure, but utterly heart wrenching.</p>
<p>After going outside to blow bubbles and eat some diced peaches, Grammy and Grampy said their goodbyes and Amber and I went back to her room where she took a much needed nap.</p>
<p>After said nap which lasted about a half hour, Caitlin from OT was ready for her. Down to Floor 6 we went to the little gym. Caitlin had Amber on the mat sitting playing a Grilling Game. At a couple points, Amber was sitting unsupported! She was able to do that all by herself while keeping her neck strong! Then she pushed and pulled a big ball a few times in a high kneel.</p>
<p>Her &ldquo;button&rdquo; (G-Tube) is still really bothering her which I feel like is delaying her with forward moving therapies. I think she&rsquo;d be willing and wanting to do so much more if it wasn&rsquo;t for the pain and soreness of the G-Tube.</p>
<p>All in all though, a good day for Amber, whose so unbelievably strong &amp; tough!</p>

		<p>Another fairly quiet day. No Physical, Occupational, or Speech Therapy today, just me and Amber spending the day together. But between meals, G-tube feedings, medications, checking vitals, it&rsquo;s amazing how quickly the day flies by. We spent some time in the morning coloring together, and watched some Minecraft videos on YouTube together (she still has to explain to me everytime why she wants to watch someone else play, instead of just playing the game herself). And later in the afternoon, we got to take a walk outside, in the sun, with Mem and Pep visiting. A short nap afterwards, then her brother and sisters came to visit.</p>
<p>But during the quieter moments, scattered throughout the day, she would gather up the courage to ask a question or two. Big questions. The Questions. The questions no parent wants to ever have to address. The questions that show just how much your child does understand what&rsquo;s going on, and how little you can actually shield them from.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why me?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>
<p>When can I go home?</p>
<p>Will this happen to my children?</p>
<p>And bigger questions, that I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to write here.</p>
<p>And of course, she wants answers. So I do my best to answer, to be honest, but to do so at a 6 year old level &ndash; and learn along the way that I apparently don&rsquo;t give 6 year olds enough credit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard. But it is necessary. She wants to know. She deserves to know. And she is showing the bravery and uncanny maturity of someone who understands there is trouble ahead, and is bracing herself to face it, head on. She is still a 6 year old, and she is scared, but it is clear to me that she knows 100% that Caron and I are with her every step, that she is not alone in this. And so a reasonable level of honest detail from us, and a ton of love and reassurance, helps keep her courage.</p>
<p>And her Faith is strong too &ndash; I have been saying the Rosary when I stay overnight with her (alternating with Caron), usually after she falls asleep. Caron, though, has been praying with her before she falls asleep. Earlier this week, Amber asked me if I would &ldquo;pray the Rosary over her, like Mama does&rdquo;, because she understands that we are asking for God&rsquo;s help, through Mary, to help her get healthy. She knows that as long as we ask, God will help us.</p>
<p>Possibly most intriguing to me, though, is seeing her take ownership of the things in her control. Today, lunch was pasta with a side of mushy spinach. Surprisingly, she dove right into the spinach, ate up as much as she could. She never would have touched spinach like this at home, so I asked her why she was eating it instead of the pasta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, spinach makes you strong. And when I get strong, I can go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God, please grant Amber strength for the journey ahead. I can&rsquo;t wait for Amber to come home &hellip;</p>

		<p><i>As Matt noted reading this post before I published it &ndash; this post is a rollercoaster, just like the journey we are on.</i></p>
<p>Day 31 . . .</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we are on day 31. On one hand, it&rsquo;s all been a blur because I can&rsquo;t believe we are already on day 31. However, my mind, body, energy, and even my spirit, are just exhausted . . . because it&rsquo;s been 31 days. That&rsquo;s me. So how does Amber feel? Her mind, body, energy, and most likely her spirit, are different; injured; foreign. My poor baby girl, this must be all too much for her. And all she wants to do is just go home. We tell her it&rsquo;s only a couple more weeks, but is it? Are we all just naive and optimistic, when we really shouldn&rsquo;t be? I&rsquo;m trying to be hopeful in all this but it is truly hard. For me, it&rsquo;s the unknown that&rsquo;s defeating me and bringing me down.</p>
<p>I try not to use the word &ldquo;hate&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s ugly. But I hate this situation so much. I hate seeing Amber suffer. I hate seeing the kids on her floor, Floor 8 (The Cancer Ward) suffering, and I hate for all kids in this hospital to be suffering. Kids are innocent, and this should NOT be happening to them. It&rsquo;s just not right.</p>
<p>Amber&rsquo;s been in pain after having the G-Tube put in but I have to chuckle because no matter how much discomfort she&rsquo;s in, she is so darn polite! She&rsquo;s cying from being jostled around and she still says her pleases and thank you&rsquo;s to us and the nurses. I laugh because it&rsquo;s cute but inside my heart it breaks. It breaks for her innocence and sweetness. And as I write this, I cry . . . because it&rsquo;s just not right. It should be me in her place, not her.</p>
<p>There is so much to worry about and I&rsquo;m trying not to let it consume me, but it&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>Thank God for Matt. My rock, my heart, my partner and my love. When I feel down he picks me up. I honestly couldn&rsquo;t ask for a more perfect partner to be by my side during this topsey-turvey nightmare. He gives me strength when I need it so that I can have that extra strength for Amber; for our children; for him. Him and I, we&rsquo;ve got this &mdash; together, as a team with Amber. God, I thank you for him;  for them.</p>
