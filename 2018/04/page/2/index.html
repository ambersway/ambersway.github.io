		<p>Today was a fairly routine day. Which is unusual, because we don&rsquo;t really have much of a regular routine. But, one is starting to develop, and having some regularity, some predictability, is a good thing.</p>
<p>After a breakfast of oatmeal, Amber and I did a little bit of coloring. Again, she did a great job coloring inside the lines (better than me, anyway!), so that right-hand control and vision are recovering well. She can&rsquo;t do it long, though, before it tires her hand out, but we are getting further each time.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-299 alignnone size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915.jpg" width="1559" height="1670" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915.jpg 1559w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-280x300.jpg 280w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-956x1024.jpg 956w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-768x823.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-1434x1536.jpg 1434w" sizes="(max-width: 1559px) 100vw, 1559px"></p>
<p>But, as always, I like to push things a bit. At the bottom of the page she was coloring were a couple of words, so I asked her to read them. It took her a few seconds, but very clearly (and correctly) read them out as &ldquo;Queen Cat&rdquo;! This is an improvement from a few days ago, where reading was a frustrating exercise for her.</p>
<p>Occupational Therapy and Speech Therapy came to visit shortly after, and they brought Amber down to the Play Room to play some Connect Four. Between having her sit upright for the game, making her right hand support her left hand to pick up and drop the checkers, and having Amber speak to ask for more pieces or state how many were in a row, they were really pushing her &ndash; and she was pushing right through quite well, and having fun too.</p>
<p>She was pretty tired after, but enjoyed a pasta lunch, and then a trip to the PT gym, where she got to ride on a swing while exercising!</p>
<p>Finally a short nap before dinner, and some quiet TV time before prayers and bed.</p>
<p>She misses home terribly, misses her cat Rea, her friends, her toys. She even told us she wants to come home to<a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/18/day-28-the-voice-of-an-angel/"> catch up on homework</a>, because she misses school so much. And unfortunately, we have at least a few more weeks in this hospital room. But, with a little bit of routine to make life less chaotic, she is establishing her own &ldquo;new normal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Her courage and strength amaze me.</p>

		<p><a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/03/22/day-1-carons-morning/">Four weeks ago today</a>, I carried an unconscious, lifeless Amber into the Backus Hospital Emergency Department, not having a clue what kind of journey was beginning for us. And worse, not sure if I would ever see her awake again. Four weeks later, Amber is not only awake, but is smiling, talking, and giving me sass. Yes, still a long road ahead. But for both Caron and me, our baseline has been dramatically reset; we are far more appreciative of every minute, of every action than we ever would have imagined.</p>
<p>Today was another day of progress, with several new &ldquo;firsts&rdquo;: sitting on a toilet, blowing bubbles, eating three meals (pancakes for breakfast, mac and cheese for lunch, and pasta for dinner), playing a board game. 30 days ago, these would have been a normal part of the day; today, I am ecstatic with each of these! She continues to make great progress day after day, and we will do whatever it takes to keep that momentum moving.</p>
<p>Her strength amazes me. She continues to work hard, until she falls asleep exhausted at the end of the day. But she also still gives me &ldquo;the look&rdquo;, that smirk and eye roll, the &ldquo;did you really just say/do that daddy?&rdquo; expression, reminding me that she is very much my little girl.</p>
<p>Every day she understands a little more about what is going on. Her biggest personal challenge right now is just that she misses home so much, she just wants to get back to her bed, with her cat Rea, with her toys, with her family. This brings her to tears multiple times a day &ndash; but it is also a source of motivation for her, because she knows that to go home, she has to &ldquo;get strong&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s what the hospital is helping her do.</p>
<p>She is a 6 year old (sorry, 6 &ldquo;and a half&rdquo; year old) supergirl.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we have commented many times on our ongoing experience here with Connecticut Children&rsquo;s Medical Center. But in this post marking our four week milestone, I&rsquo;d like to express special thanks to the people at the Backus Hospital Emergency Department; Dr Adams, the ED team, the Lifestar team, and any others that March 22 morning &ndash; your quick assessment and actions that morning were the difference between hope and despair for us. I cannot express the depth of my appreciation for your work, your skill, and the fact that Amber is here with us today because of you. I ask that the prayerful readers of this post join me in praying that God bless these medical professionals, and all medical professionals around the globe, that they may have the strength, clarity, and will to apply their skill everytime the need arises, providing great care as they did for Amber.</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if she&rsquo;d ever be able to speak again. It was a fear that ran through my mind constantly these past 3 1/2 weeks. It was possible right? I mean she had an unknown tumor that burst which caused a major stroke and 2 brain surgeries. So the possibility of not speaking again (among other fears) was right up there on my list of possible outcomes from all this.</p>
<p>I can tell you in fact that Amber has the voice of an angel. It is soft, sweet, gentle, and. . . well, angelic. It&rsquo;s hers, it&rsquo;s our Amber&rsquo;s, and I will forever thank God for it.</p>
<p>Last night Amber told me that she misses home. I can&rsquo;t blame her. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine everything she has and is going through and how absolutely terrifying it must be for her. &ldquo;What do you miss most about home?&rdquo; I ask. She starts to cry. . . &ldquo;Rea&rdquo; she says. Rea is our 16 1/2 year old cat and Amber&rsquo;s buddy.</p>
<p>This morning Amber says &ldquo;I want to go home&hellip;&rdquo; I cringe a little because I know what&rsquo;s coming next. &ldquo;Why do you want to go home?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Because I want to do my homework&rdquo;. That response completely sideswipes me!! Ha Ha!! Does she really maturely understand enough to put the fact of how long she&rsquo;s been in here with how much school she&rsquo;s missed which results in just how much work she needs to make up?  Perhaps so.</p>
<p>Her G-Tube spot is still sore, especially when Lauren from PT got her in and out of beds, wheelchairs, and floor mats. We got to do PT down on the 6th floor where their gym is. On the wall in there it says &ldquo;Super Heroes in Training&rdquo;. Ain&rsquo;t that the truth!</p>
<p>After a shower, Amber was exhausted but stayed awake enough to enjoy her 1st lunch tray meal! After some bites of Mac and Cheese, carrots, and chicken, she washed it all down with apple juice from a straw! She did so well that she has advanced to 3 soft food meals a day AND soft snacks and clear liquids with Matt or I!!!</p>
<p>I have to say that I am in awe of Amber Grace. She is so brave and so tough. I cannot thank God enough for her and for her being here with us today. I also cannot thank you all enough for your continued prayers, love, and support through this tumultuous journey. It helps us more than you will ever know. . . &#128156;</p>

		<p>Amber&rsquo;s G-Tube placement was a success. She was in a bit of discomfort during the night and a bit of today. However, the more annoying thing that bothered her today was wearing her helmet &mdash; which aggravated her healing (and very itchy) scalp.</p>
<p>After some OT on the mat that consisted of playing Legos and Squigz with our fill-in therapist Erin, Amber ended the session in her chair. She did well in the chair for a while. . . but that poor itchy scalp, being contained in a warm stifling helmet, was not making Amber a happy camper anymore. Once back in bed, helmetless, with a very much needed gentle head massage, and then cold damp facecloth, Amber was back to her content self.</p>
<p>A few hours later it was time for PT and ST together. The therapists were surprised and amazed by Amber&rsquo;s words and communication! Amber went down with Lauren on the floor mat and worked on building her neck muscles. Lauren seemed pleasantly surprised at Amber&rsquo;s controlled neck movements; an improvement since Friday. After some more PT, it was time for ST. Sara asked the question Amber has been waiting to hear since Saturday. . . &ldquo;Amber are you hungry?&rdquo;. Her eyes lit up with a big nod. But Sara wasn&rsquo;t letting her off the hook &ldquo;You have to tell me Amber, are you hungry?&rdquo;. . . Amber looks at Sara, starts to nod again but catches it, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;. Sara gives her a list of items she can choose from and Amber settles on &ldquo;Vanilla Pudding&rdquo;. Next question was if she wanted something to drink. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Amber chose &ldquo;Apple Juice&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After Sara came back with the items, she had Amber begin with the pudding. Sara took a spoonful, and Amber took a bite. Sara scooped up another spoonful and asked if Amber could feed it to herself. A head nod and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, so Sara hands it to Amber who proceeds to give herself a proper bite. Like, a direct hit into her mouth bite! After a few more like this Sara thinks out loud saying &ldquo;I wonder if we should try Graham Crackers? Amber do you like Graham Crackers?&rdquo;. Amber nods and says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I run and grab some Graham Crackers and hand them to Sara. While Sara breaks off a piece she reminds Amber not to shove the whole thing in her mouth &mdash; and she doesn&rsquo;t. Amber takes a perfect Amber-sized bite, chews it and swallows. Takes another bite, chews and swallows. Now if I wasn&rsquo;t Amber&rsquo;s mom and didn&rsquo;t know the backstory of the fact that Amber hasn&rsquo;t had solid food now for 27 days, I&rsquo;d think this is just another healthy kid having a plain old typical snack. What she did was so effortless!</p>
<p>Rockstar. That&rsquo;s what they all called Amber. After the Graham Crackers was Apple Juice, which Sara started off using a spoon for but by the end Amber was sipping from the cup. After some sips and a cough, she had some more. Then, she was done. . . She pointed to the bed and told them she was &ldquo;tired&rdquo;. She did well, really well. The girl deserves a break!</p>
<p>All I can say is, that&rsquo;s my girl, that&rsquo;s my Rockstar! Sara said that she is ready to try a lunch tray meal tomorrow!!  Bring it on!!</p>
<p>So many blessings and miracles and happiness for Amber (and us). God is Good.</p>

		<p>Amber just came out of the OR.  G-tube installation was successful, and almost all of the stitches/staples have been removed from her head (just a few left in place to keep things healing properly).  The feeding tube has also been removed from her nose, so there is nothing covering her beautiful face at all now.  She is just waking up as I type, and is smiling.  We will all be heading back to her room pretty soon.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the prayers, please keep &rsquo;em coming!!  But for today so far, we are looking good!</p>

		<p>Amber did a whole lotta nothing today, and that&rsquo;s okay. The way this girl has been working hard this past week, a day of rest was very much earned and well deserved.</p>
<p>A little bit of talking, a little bit of writing, a little visiting, a little TV watching, and a little bit of coloring was about the extent of the day.</p>
<p>A day of relaxing is very much needed to prepare for the week ahead, starting with the biggest upcoming event, insertion of G-tube &amp; removal of staples and stitches in the head tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind, extra prayers for Amber&rsquo;s surgery tomorrow would be very much appreciated!! Thank you everyone!! &#128156;</p>

		<p>We started the day with a trip to the imaging department, for a fluoroscopy to confirm all of her internals are flowing correctly, to prepare for the g-tube surgery on Monday. Was pretty cool watching in real-time as the contrast worked it&rsquo;s way through her system, with the scanning machine snapping dozens of pictures. Everything looks good, so we are full steam ahead for Monday.</p>
<p>We returned to the room, and started to watch TV, when I decided to try something else &ndash; because too much TV isn&rsquo;t good for anyone. I handed Amber a crayon, and held a coloring book in her lap. And she immediately started coloring! Not just scribbles across the page either &ndash; she stayed inside the lines, indicating (to me, anyway) both good vision and good control. She didn&rsquo;t get very far on her picture before tiring out, but this work of art is going right on the fridge!!</p>
<p>But then, as I&rsquo;m putting things away, I think I hear Amber breathing roughly, like she did when the breathing tube was removed. I look over, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be struggling at all &ndash; when I realize that she is moving her lips and making sounds! I can&rsquo;t quite make out what she is saying, but she is definitely trying to talk. So I encourage her and tell her I love her, and I ask if she can say &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; &ndash; AND SHE DOES! Very softly, but more than just a whisper, and very clear. It is pretty hard for her, but she is excited, we are excited, and she does it several more times during the day. This is another major milestone for her!</p>
<p>Then, we cap it all off by taking her for a stroll outside. It&rsquo;s a beautiful sunny day, about 70&deg;F, and Amber&rsquo;s Physical Therapist got everything lined up so we could take her out in her wheelie chair for about 40 minutes. To make things even sweeter, her Speech Therapist lined up the permission for us to feed her a popsicle, so we are outside in the sun, eating the best tasting orange popsicle ever, with her brother and sisters, aunt and uncle visiting too. This was a wonderful picture to see.</p>
<p>Lots of beautiful pictures today, surpassed only by the beauty of a few words, delivered by our beautiful Amber. We thank God for letting us experience this beauty today.</p>

		<p>Another busy, exhausting day for Amber &ndash; but again, forward progress.</p>
<p>Physical Therapy had her on the floor with me today, and tried a few positions.  She did well propping herself up on her elbows (yes, both of them!), but was pretty worn out from <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/12/day-22-evening-addition/">yesterday&rsquo;s PT</a> so she didn&rsquo;t last very long.  She woke up a bit, though, with Speech Therapy.  While she didn&rsquo;t want the chocolate ice cream they tried first, she definitely liked the orange popsicle.  After a bit of a nap, we got back on the floor with Occupational Therapy, and I got to <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/12/day-22-snuggle-time/">snuggle</a> with her a bit.  Then it was nap time again.</p>
<p>A quiet evening, but then it was decided that Amber should have GI scan tomorrow morning to prep for the g-tube surgery on Monday.  So, we are switching off her food at midnight tonight, and supplying only liquids, by IV &ndash; but of course, her one remaining IV decided it&rsquo;s been in too long (3 weeks) and needed to be replaced.  Amber&rsquo;s veins decided not to cooperate too well (they&rsquo;ve been through a lot lately), so it took 3 tries with lots of tears &ndash; but it&rsquo;s done, and I sit here now watching her sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>I prayed the Rosary earlier tonight, reflecting on the Sorrowful Mysteries.  I may not be able to understand exactly what Amber is going through herself, the fear, the pain, her trial.  But as a parent, as Amber&rsquo;s Dad, I find my own pain, my agony, in not being able to take this for her, in not being able to just fix this for her, in not being able understand why this must happen.</p>
<p>And so I have spent much time praying to Mary, asking for her intercession as a sympathetic parent.  At this point, we know what Amber must go through (there is no looking back), so we just pray for the strength for her to continue forward, and the strength for us to carry her, to take as much of this burden as we are allowed.  And as we have throughout our journey so far, we pray for those that are providing medical care to Amber, that they have the strength and clarity to continue to provide the best possible care they can.</p>

		<p>Amber thoroughly made my day today . . .</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m home with the kiddos today. This afternoon Ryan suggested a video chat with Amber and Daddy. I give them a call and Matt informs me that Amber had just fallen asleep (whoops!). As we&rsquo;re talking, Amber wakes up, so Matt brings the phone over to her. As usual, I&rsquo;m kissing into the phone and blowing her kisses.  Matt says &ldquo;Amber, can you blow Mama some kisses back?&rdquo;. As I watch what happens next, I&rsquo;m stunned. Amber is not only making the kiss noise (more movement than actual noise) but her beautiful little right hand comes up towards her mouth at the same time! Not quite all the way because her hand is restrained (she wants to scratch her healing head all the time). So, Matt frees her hand and asks her to do it again &mdash; AND SHE DOES &mdash; she brings that little hand all the way up to her mouth and blows me kisses!!! WHAT?? I am still shocked so I ask &ldquo;Has she been doing this all day with you?&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;This is completely new, right now, what she&rsquo;s doing with you!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am STILL in disbelief right now even as I write this. Thank you Ryan for suggesting the video call. Thank you Amber for doing something new and amazing today. And Thank you God, for making this little miracle happen.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a busy day. Amber continues to do well. PT with Lauren consisted of gym mat on the floor doing exercises. During Amber&rsquo;s &ldquo;rest time&rdquo;, Lauren let me do <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/12/day-22-snuggle-time/">snuggle time</a> with Amber. Let me tell you, that meant THE world to me. The last time I got to &ldquo;snuggle&rdquo; Amber was in between her throwing up every hour 3 weeks ago. So snuggle time today meant more than you know. After exercises on the mat, Lauren was able to get Amber to do a tall kneeling (like when we pray) against the hospital bed. Amber was supported by Lauren but held herself up by herself too, Lauren seemed pretty amazed, as did I! After that was wheelchair time, where we took Amber for a tour of Floor 8.</p>
<p>Speech Therapy was next. While Amber was still in her chair, resting, Sara came in with a cup of chocolate ice cream. It did not seem promising at first as Amber was tightly pursing her lips together. After a bit of persuading, Amber took a small bite! After another small bite, and a few sips of water, Amber graduated to two big bites!</p>
<p>And lastly, OT time. Caitlin made good use of the floor mat as well. She had Amber sitting up against her and had me hold a stack of Legos. Amber took a block off the top! She did it again! Next I loosened a top Lego and Amber pushed it down twice. After that, Caitlin got Amber down on her side for a bit where it looked like she was about to conk off! Then, tummy time where Caitlin was helping Amber with her neck. Amber was starting to get uncomfortable, so it was back to her side and then back to sitting against Caitlin. Then Caitlin asked if we&rsquo;d like to do snuggle time &mdash; Um, you don&rsquo;t have to ask me twice!!</p>
<p>With Amber in my arms against me, Caitlin sets me up with my back against a pillow, and pillow against Amber&rsquo;s hospital bed, so I could be more comfortable. With my baby girl laying against me again, I can&rsquo;t help but feel like it&rsquo;s been an eternity since she&rsquo;s been in my arms like this. But we&rsquo;re here in the now and I will cherish this day forever.</p>
