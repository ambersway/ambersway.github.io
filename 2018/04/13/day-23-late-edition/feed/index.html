	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt/Caron- I&#8217;m going to speak on the behalf of your daughter Amber for alittle. Its more of a spiritual aspect that Amber is going through right now. She Knows that she needs to keep fighting but its not her! Its the Lords strength in her right now FIGHTING. You need to pray over her evry morning for all needs. BUT tell her to listen to that Voice inside of her

					<description><![CDATA[I think of you as a family everyday and pray for God’s strength to infuse Amber and you as her parents as you try to balance everything.  I pray for her sweet sisters and for Ryan.  I pray for Grandparents as they try to fill the gap.  I think of her extended family who love you guys too.  *Isaiah 43:2, *Romans 8:38-39  May the God of all comfort, Comfort you all now and going forward.  *Phil 4:7.]]></description>
