	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way â€“ with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
Sorry to read about your heartache today, But Like Dr Paul said that coming off all the sedatives has to be exhausting. But as a parent seeing less activity is worrisome. You just want that spunky, active, dancing Amber. I canâ€™t even beginning to image the millions of thoughts that run threw yours and Caronâ€™s heads every minute of everyday.
I am happy to hear Amber is doing well even if exhausted. Weâ€™ll continue to take those small baby steps forward anyway we can. Get some rest. Love you guys.]]></description>
