	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Caron,
Having read your blog, I can only say how brave you and Matt are in such a very challenging situation!  I can only imagine what the two of you are going through!  Please remember, you are a mother, and a mother always feels for her child.  It isn&#8217;t always easy to put on a brave front.  You are human and you have emotions that are perfectly normal.  I pray for you every day for the strength that you need and for Amber&#8217;s health. You  and Matt are such people of faith, but you also have emotions.  Know that I pray for small miracles for Amber, whatever they might be. At some point, there will be a light at the end of the tunnel.  You have lots of love and support from all of us here at St. Joseph School!!!

					<description><![CDATA[Caron, you are amazing and have inspired me for 25 years. You have a sense of purpose, grounded in strong values that have never wavered. You&#8217;ve had moments of uncertainty or self doubt before, and have always been strong to power through. 
This is a tough road Amber&#8217;s on, but she&#8217;ll have her super mom and dad there to support her every day. And we&#8217;re here for you. Love you sweetie!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

					<description><![CDATA[Caron you are not a coward, you have been one of most sweetest woman I know with a hugh heart.  Your emotions are raw and completely expected.  When you are in your valley, just know God is carrying you out.  I&#8217;m sure it seems dark and alone emotionally going through this, but many prayers are sent daily and God will do the right thing.   Love you and stay strong.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Caron&#8230;..
This was the text you were suppose to get yesterday and it did not go through. Weird because maybe I&#8217;m suppose to post it here?? 
I was checking on you after reading Ambers blog about her feeding tube being put back in. It broke my heart you were in pain watching your super hero girl going through this again and being in discomfort. At least we know she is getting the nutrients she needs. This will help her get and stay strong for her long battle ahead. 
They say God does not give us more then we can&#8217;t handle.
Remembering the blog of your super girl got me thinking. Every super hero has a super MOM  and you my lady are Wonder Women!!! Really!!
I said this before and will always continue to say this. I am in love with you!! You are who I strive to be. You are not just a wonderful person but a wonderful wife, mother, daughter, sister, and an even more amazing women!! Truly!
You got this!!! As mom&#8217;s we have to.
 Holding you in the kitchen that day when I saw you, I really was at a few points holding you up. You were tried and so heart broken. You, even then Caron, you were strong. You might not have thought so in that moment, but YOU were. You did what you needed to do in those moments and moved on. You are so allowed those moments. This sucks and is unfair and very hard. 
I Thank you for allowing me to hold you in those moments.
After it was over you knew that you still had/have so much to do. 
Amber has such a long road ahead and an even  bigger battle to fight. You are her Wonder Women!!!. You, The whole Smith Family are fighting this battle as well. You all have a long road. It&#8217;s going to be hard.
Remembering that they have the most wonderful Mom/Wife ever is what&#8217;s going to get them all threw it.
When you do not feel so wonderful. Text me. Please. Even if to yell or just cry it out&#8230;..but get it out
I GOT YOU!! And YOU GOT THIS!!
I love you Caron Smith!!
