	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Makes my heart smile!!! So good to hear her progress. Though a long road lays before Amber, she is working hard and showing just how strong she is. Can&#8217;t wait to hear her talk for the first time once again. Cousin Noah wants to video chat with her. Possibly this weekend if Amber is up for it? Love you all so much and miss you even more.

					<description><![CDATA[That is great to hear!  So happy to hear that she is making these amazing steps.  We are all praying and pulling for her to continue to have the strength that God as given to her.  She is quite a fighter and we miss her immensely in the classroom.  Tell her that her class pet is wondering where her fish food is.]]></description>
