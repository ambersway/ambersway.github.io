	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugh‚Ä¶.you Matt are the strength your family needs. Being the rock for Caron and the warmth and gentleness to those babes. You Sir are a ROCK. I know your heart aches and breaks quietly because you have no other choice.
You are the base of the tree that supports your family. You break, they break. But do so in Silence. When no one is around  Unfair, yes. But they need you so very much Daddy!!! So much a husband, a provider, a protector, and so so so much more. I pray for you Matt, to keep being strong, to keep going, which you will‚Ä¶.you have to!! Just know that you have so much support and love behind you: Caron, Marie, Brianna, Amber, and Ryan.  You are so strong and powerful in your love and support. Please, if you ever need anything‚Ä¶even to vent, call me. Reach out no matter how it why.
MAYBE even God‚Ä¶to whoever, but do so regardless. I am so sorry little brother.( Yes, I am older than you, but let‚Äôs not talk about that now. )
Just know 2000 plus miles is nothing. We‚Äôd be there at a moments notice. I love you Matt!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so sad and so sorry Amber and your whole family are dealing with something like this. It‚Äôs completely wrong. I know everyone must feel exhausted; emotionally and physically and that‚Äôs totally normal but knowing that probably doesn‚Äôt make you feel a whole lot better. Amber‚Äôs going home; I have no doubt of it. She is an amazing little girl who has already faced enormous challenges and circumstances and she will continue to do that with the love of her family and the skill of her medical team. Stay strong and be brave and celebrate how far you all have come on this journey. I can‚Äôt wait for the day Amber goes home! Help her plan for it; what is her favorite dinner? What will she want to wear? What‚Äôs the first thing she wants to do? Does she want a big cake?]]></description>
