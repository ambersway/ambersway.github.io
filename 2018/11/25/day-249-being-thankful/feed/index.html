	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt, Caron and family,

Again I came to see how we can pray, how we can minister and I find myself being blessed by your strength, faith and wisdom far more than I am capable of blessing in return. I wish your family weren‚Äôt living through what you are right now, that I could take all of the pain and fear away but we all know that‚Äôs not really in human hands and that, while the future always contains some pain, our Creator has a plan for us that will work for good. You remind me of something that C. S. Lewis wrote in one of his letters:

‚ÄúWe are not necessarily doubting that God will do the best for us; we are wondering how painful the best will turn out to be.‚Äù

And yet you choose, as we all should, to walk forward in faith and strength cherishing all that is good.  Once again, when I grow up I wanna be like you.

Con abrasos,
Chuck]]></description>
