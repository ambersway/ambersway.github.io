	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
     We were so glad that the new meds are not as bad as was thought to have been on Amber. All of you have been through far to much with Amber leading the way all along!  WE would have stopped in months ago BUT I have been dealing with a darned infection of my good leg and lymph nodes in that area . We are not sure what has caused this to come on but I am finding myself spending a week in the hospital on Vancomycin until all of teh veins in both arms are shot and then I am sent home to recover somewhat until the leg becomes 4 times the size and as red as a cooked lobster and off I go again for another week of antibiotics.  I did NOT want to have Amber&#8217;s immune system compromised in anyway because of my leg issues so it was best that I stayed home and prayed for all of you.   If you are home this weekend and would like to come to the Highland festival in Scotland on Sunday ( 10/07/18) ((  Yes, I know, the same day that you use to have the birthday party as I well remember coming home after working at the festival all day long, still in my kilt, etc with you offering me a much needed brew.!!))  PLEASE let me know, call me, text or e-mail me and I will arrange for your visit. You can come before teh festival is opened up officially at 12 noon ( anytime after 0900) OR come for teh opening ceremonies, watch the Highland Games, the celtic dance competitions, the individual Bagpipe competitions plus we have six bands coming to perform for teh crowds and a entertainment tent where a couple bands from Scotland ( UK) will be performing.  Take care, call me if you need anything at all done!!!     Reg &#038; Elaine
