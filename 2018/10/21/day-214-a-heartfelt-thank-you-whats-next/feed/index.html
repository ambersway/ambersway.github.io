	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sending prayers and warm thoughts for Amber and all your family. Poor kid has been through so much, is still dealing with so much, is fighting such a battle, no WONDER she gets a headache!! She is likely feeling stressed but may not know how to fully express it. Maybe keeping a little diary of the kind of day she&#8217;s had, etc. could help isolate the circumstances around the times she gets a headache. &#8216;Cause in the middle of a super-scary time, maybe a headache is just a headache&#8230;.
