	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way â€“ with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to let you know my husband and I have been praying for Amber and your family.  Last night before bed my three daughters and I did a special prayer.  We are very involved at the studio (especially my oldest). While we don&#039;t know Amber personally, it makes no difference. My family and I will continue to pray for Amber and your family and  keep the faith <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49f.png" alt="ðŸ’Ÿ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
