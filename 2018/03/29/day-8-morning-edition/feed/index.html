	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sending you all lots of healing prayers and love to remain strong for Amber. You are all on our minds and in our hearts at this time.
I found this easy prayer for Ben to say for Amber
Heavenly Father watch over Amber, and Grant that she may be restored to that perfect health which it is yours alone to give; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
