	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way â€“ with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[As this Easter day begins you all are in my thoughts and have been for the past several days. I know how life can change in an instant and I am so sorry this has happened to Amber and all your family. You and Caron have had to deal with more than any young couple should. Your love and faith is remarkable. I have seen the power of prayer work miracles and I am confident that Amber will be one of those miracles. Keep being positive and rejoice in each baby step Amber shares with you. My prayers are for your strength to get you all through this very difficult journey.]]></description>
