	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[You got on a train, let’s just look at that, you got on a train! On March 22nd of this year, no parent, no human , no individual if in your shoes would imagine that in September you would be getting on a train! None the less walking on a train with an amazing young girl, a true Miracle!! They come in small blessings, a train ride, the first day of school, heck an argument between your kids! You all have come so far, God strengthens us all. Amber, you, your wife, and family are simply just awe inspiring. God has his hand on you, he won’t guide you astray. Thank you for this blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think of Amber every day. She is remarkable and she is fortunate to have such a loving family, support network and medical options. That being said, it totally sucks that anyone, much less a young girl, should have to stare down cancer. Be brave and stay strong. You will always make the best decision possible; it could not be otherwise. Keep moving forward and take one day at a time.
