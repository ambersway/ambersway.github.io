	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are so glad to read the word HOME! Home is where the heart is and where Amber will find even more strength to keeping pushing forward. She is such an inspiration. I’m sure you all look forward to a big group snuggle session on your couch at home with all your sweet children… that will be the best…. to feel complete again all under the same roof. We wish you a happy day tomorrow and for the days to come<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2763.png" alt="❣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers. Xoxo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just so incredible from so many weeks ago. I can’t believe Ambers strength. It’s amazing!!! I know she is getting stronger each and everyday. I pray that this strenght remains with her. God remains with her. The next stages are going to be tough but she has got this incredible absolute power in her. She has beaten the odds thus far. She has so much will, strength, and power, and I can’t wait to see what else she shows us. Keep moving forward Amber!!! Praying for more added strength. We love you baby girl!!!]]></description>
