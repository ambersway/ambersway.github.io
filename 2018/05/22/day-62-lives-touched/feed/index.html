	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way â€“ with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even in darkness, there is light. 
The people you&#039;ve met along the way, they are only candles, casting light and warmth onto the dark &#038; scary path you are walking. 
Only candles, but they burn as brightly as they can, to help to fend off the shadows of doubt &#038; fear. Only candles on a path, but they will help lead you back into the sunshine.]]></description>
