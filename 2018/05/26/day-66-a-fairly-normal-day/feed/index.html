	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[How very thoughtful and loving of Ryan to be such a big help to Amber!  Your challenge is great, but as you said,  take one day at a time.  Each day is a blessing.  It was wonderful to see Amber at our Field Day, even if she wasn’t there the whole day.  Her classmates were thrilled!!  Keep up the good work Amber.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How sweet to hear how Ryan is helping with Amber. You’re a wonderful family and so fortunate to have each other. Despite the predicted rain and cool temperatures, hope you can enjoy the long weekend and maybe cuddle up inside with popcorn and a movie!]]></description>
