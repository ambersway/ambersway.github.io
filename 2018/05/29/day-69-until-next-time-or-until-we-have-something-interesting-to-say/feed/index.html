	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt and Karen, I found a beautiful passage in &#8220;A Grateful Heart&#8221; that fits Amber&#8217;s journey:  &#8220;I&#8217;ve read all the books but one Only remains sacred:  this Volume of wonders, open Always before my eyes&#8221;. May Amber Grace continue to be blessed with all the wonders of so many continuing  heartfelt prayers.  Much love, Irene
