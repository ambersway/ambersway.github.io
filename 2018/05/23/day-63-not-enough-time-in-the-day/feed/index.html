	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way â€“ with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s heartening to read that you guys have been able to keep focus on the positive, but haven&#8217;t completely ignored the negative; clouds bring rain, but rain helps the flowers grow, and there will always be more sunshine than rain.
