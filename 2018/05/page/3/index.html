		<p>There&rsquo;s been a flurry of activity yesterday and today in preparation for Amber to come home. As terrifying as it is to leave this support &mdash; this crutch; the hospital, our nurses, and our doctors, there is something to be said for <i>There&rsquo;s No Place Like Home</i>.</p>
<p>Matt and I know that going home is going to greatly help complete the task of devouring our elephant, and get us ready for the whale, which is the next phase. There&rsquo;s nothing like home . . . Home sweet home, with Amber&rsquo;s siblings, Amber&rsquo;s own bed, and best of all, Amber&rsquo;s best buddy Rea.</p>
<p>Amber has come so far and has made such great strides. It even seems that Amber&rsquo;s recovery has come along a bit more quickly than some expected early on here. Yes, Amber worked her buns off making that possible but it wasn&rsquo;t just her hard work and desire that got her to this place. As we&rsquo;ve written several times, the medical care, the human care, provided here at Connecticut Children&rsquo;s Medical Center has been incredible. But there&rsquo;s more to it than that.</p>
<p>Matt and I would like to express our gratitude to <b><i>you</i></b><i>,</i> our family and friends. You, who prayed. You, who supported. You who took the time to set up prayer services and send mass enrollment cards. For creating cards and decorations, making food, sending care packages and gifts, or even just offering a positive thought about her. All of this &mdash; this overwhelming adoration and care for our little girl and for our family, it makes our hearts and souls rejoice. I honestly wish I could open my heart and show you how full it is of love and joy.</p>
<p>You all helped in Amber&rsquo;s recovery from a major stroke. You helped Amber wake up, and move her right side, and talk, drink and eat. You helped her color, read, move her left leg and foot. You helped Amber have amazing MRI results and safe surgeries. You helped Amber to stand, walk and go up stairs. You helped her move her left arm and hand. You helped Amber to get her spunk, sweetness and sass back. YOU helped her, and you helped us. Every single one of you. God brought us together for a reason . . .</p>
<p>&#128156; From the bottom of our hearts, Thank You &#128156;</p>

		<p>Everything is lining up for discharge on Thursday! Of course, nothing is done until it&rsquo;s done, but we are almost there!</p>
<p>As nurses stop in to say bye because we won&rsquo;t see them over the next few days, it&rsquo;s a bit funny to know we&rsquo;ll miss them. We wish, more than anything, that we weren&rsquo;t here, that this never happened. But &ndash; it did. And we met some incredible people who have helped us through this, who have become a part of our lives over the past 7 weeks. As anxious as we are to get home, and even knowing we will be back frequently as part of the ongoing treatment process, we will miss the people here.  The nurses, the admins, the custodians, the techs, the security guards, the PCAs, the doctors, the social workers, the therapists &ndash; they have all been part of this with us.  And we thank all of them so much for helping Amber recover so well.</p>
<p>Even in these last days here, Amber continues to push, to develop. Today she walked up and down the flight of stairs in the PT gym twice, then down the hall to the elevator with her walker, and from the elevator all the way down to her room. Then during OT, she is supporting herself on her LEFT elbow, and squeezing that LEFT hand, and moving the whole LEFT arm! I didn&rsquo;t think we would see that before we left here, and was nervous about what that would mean. Still a lot of work to do with that arm and leg, but compared to where we were 48 days ago, it&rsquo;s amazing progress!  And even though she was exhausted from all that work, she still wanted to attend two art sessions today!</p>
<p>So, a few more days and we&rsquo;ll be home.  Now we pray that Amber is as strong, determined, and successful in this next phase of treatment.</p>
<p>Thank you all for being part of this with us.</p>

		<p>Amber had an AWESOME day!</p>
<p>Getting ready this morning Amber chose her Supergirl pajamas, which basically set the bar for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>In PT with Ms. Lauren and Ms. Amanda, she blew their socks off by not only walking 100 feet with the walker and some assistance but when we went down to the gym on Floor 6, she walked UP and DOWN 4 steps, TWICE! Once assisted with Ms. Lauren and the last with me. 16 steps!</p>
<p>Then in OT with Ms. Caitlin, Amber MOVED her LEFT ARM and HAND! I kid you not! Amber&rsquo;s been squeezing our fingers a little bit the past few days with her left hand but this was just amazing! She has a long way to go, like the way her left leg and foot were but, wow . . . just wow!</p>
<p><i><b>Amber&rsquo;s Way: She&rsquo;s Determined, Strong-Willed, Tough, and Ready To Get This Thing DONE. *~* She&rsquo;s SUPER AMBER GRACE *~* </b></i></p>
<p>And to end the day, more great news. We got the word from Dr. Martin that Thursday &mdash; This Thursday, is the day Amber should be able to come home! Furthermore, how coincidental and appropriate that this Thursday is also Ascension Thursday; when Jesus&rsquo; body ascended into Heaven &mdash; He went home too!</p>
<p>Amber is on her way, fast and furious. The evidence is clear just how BIG her fighting spirit is &mdash; more than ever, especially with a discharge date only a few days away. Amber has proved which way she wants to go, and go she shall!</p>
<p>I will leave you with a fitting quote that was posted up in the Post-Op room last Thursday:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800080;"><b>Good, better, best. Never let it rest. </b></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800080;"><b>&lsquo;Til your good is better and your better is best.</b></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800080;"><b>&ndash; St. Jerome</b></span></h2>
</blockquote>

		<p>Amber and I had a nice quiet day together. So with that, I&rsquo;ve decided to write about something else that&rsquo;s been on my mind.</p>
<p>In the Pre-Op room on Thursday, we were introduced to the head nurse that would be in with Amber during her procedure. Her name was Beata. Beata, as it turns out, was the one that also took care of baby Lily (and Cutie) in the OR, adorning her head in wrappings and ports, to match Amber. Beata and Amber&rsquo;s team did not have to do this extra thing, these extra steps. It most likely set the nurses and doctors back from their next appointments, and they probably fell behind in their schedule a bit. But instead, these doctors and nurses went above and beyond to take Amber&rsquo;s comfort to the next level, to have her baby come out safe and sound with the same exact recovery as Amber herself. This sentiment speaks volumes of the hospital.</p>
<p>For me however, the sentiment goes further. Amber&rsquo;s head nurse that day was Beata, as I mentioned earlier. When we were introduced to her and she told us her name, my mind immediately went to the word: Beatitudes. I took a mental note to look those up later because at this particular point, it was go time and I was able to go in the OR with Amber while she fell asleep. Later, in the waiting room, after I said my prayers in the hospital&rsquo;s chapel, I finally got to look up the Beatitudes. You see, I couldn&rsquo;t quite remember on my own what these were because it&rsquo;s been a long time since my CCD and CYO classes.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, The Beatitudes are eight blessings recounted by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount in the gospel of Matthew. The eight Beatitudes are:</p>
<p><i>* (1) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</i><span><i> </i></span></span><br>
<i>* (2) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are those who mourn: for they will be comforted.</i><span><i> </i></span></span><br>
<i>* (3) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are the meek: for they will inherit the earth.</i><span><i> </i></span></span><br>
<i>* (4) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they will be filled.</i></span><br>
<i>* (5) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are the</i><span><i> </i></span></span><i>merciful</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i>: for they will be shown mercy.</i></span><br>
<i>* (6) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are the pure in heart: for they will see God.</i></span><br>
<i>* (7) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are the peacemakers: for they will be called children of God.</i></span><br>
<i>* (8) Blessed</i><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><i> are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i></span></p>
<p>Reading further into #5 about mercy, there is another<span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"> notable devotion associated with the works of mercy, the<span> </span></span>Divine Mercy &mdash; which<span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"> are reputed to be related to the apparitions of<span> </span></span>Jesus Christ<span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);"><span> </span>that appeared to<span> </span></span>Saint Faustina Kowalska. I can&rsquo;t help but think about how we prayed with Amber a few weeks ago with Saint Faustina&rsquo;s relic . . .</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Beata. The name Beata, which derives from Latin and means beatus, or blessed. God blessed us with Beata watching over Amber, and Lily. Amber is blessed by God with her recovery thus far. And we are blessed for so much; Amber, the nurses, doctors, staff at CCMC, our families, our friends, our aquaintences. We are at the mercy of God in all of this &mdash; from the beginning to the end.</p>

		<p>After a restful night and a yummy well deserved breakfast of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Amber was ready to tackle the day.</p>
<p>Our fill-in Physical Therapist was Ms. Sue. Ms. Sue had never had Amber before so she was taking it very careful, very gingerly with her. However at one point when Sue asked if Amber could try to stand up, and Amber did &mdash; tall and firm, Ms. Sue could now see that Amber was no delicate flower. And with that, the two of them went off, slowly but surely, down the hall, walker and Ms. Sue helping, for a total distance of around 50 feet!</p>
<p>Amber also got to enjoy some fresh Spring air outside today as well. The best part of being outside though? Amber didn&rsquo;t have to wear her &ldquo;stinkin&rdquo; helmet!!!! She calls it that because it&rsquo;s been nothing but problems and quite uncomfortable from the start. And what has Amber been telling everyone what she plans to do with that &ldquo;stinkin'&rdquo; helmet when she gets home? &ldquo;I want Daddy to run it over with his truck and then I want to throw it in the fire pit&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Thatta Girl!</p>

		<p>Following the <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/05/03/day-43-surgery-went-well/">successful surgery yesterday</a>, we spent the following 24 hours in the ICU.&nbsp; Unfortunately, between the after-effects of surgery, the variety of medications for pain; sedation, seizure, nausea, constipation, and the general constant noise of the monitors and business of the ICU, Amber decided she didn&rsquo;t want to sleep.&nbsp; So while I went to bed around 10 PM and swapped with Caron at 2AM, we each got around 4 hours of sleep, Amber got a total of&nbsp;<em>maybe</em> 30 minutes of sleep.&nbsp; By the time morning rolled around, the combination of exhaustion and medications had her very disoriented, and was messing with her vision.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t remember where she was, at one point even thinking she was outside.&nbsp; She told me it looked like I had another nose coming out of my cheek, and then she thought there was a dragon flying around the room.</p>
<p>And &ndash; she was cranky, like any 6 year old would be after 24+ hours awake.&nbsp; Heck, I would be cranky too if I had gone through what she has been through. And this manifested itself repeatedly through the day with her breaking into sobs of despair, wailing through the tears about how much she misses home.</p>
<p>As her parents, this is all heartbreaking to watch.&nbsp; But oddly, it is much less concerning than it would have been 6 weeks ago when we started this.&nbsp; Our baseline has been reset.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;ve become numb to this, it&rsquo;s just that we have a better understanding and appreciation of the risks and impacts now, and we&rsquo;ve come to know and trust the people taking care of Amber.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t jump every time one of the monitors beeps now.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;<em>worst&nbsp;</em>thing she experiences coming out of one of these surgeries is an imaginary dragon, then that is far better than what we thought&nbsp;our&nbsp;<em>best</em> cases might be 6 weeks ago.</p>
<p>But the real Dragons, the unknown, the uncharted territory, lie ahead of us, and not so far away anymore.&nbsp; Amber will be getting her wish of heading home soon.&nbsp; And while there is tremendous relief in this, it is also a bit terrifying to know we will be the sole caregivers for her again, with some new responsibilities beyond what our parenting role had been before.&nbsp; But, we embrace this, we will do whatever needs to be done.&nbsp; And we are very appreciative for the support of our family and friends in helping us through this, and through the scarier Dragons that loom further into the future.</p>
<p>Amber was cleared to return to her room on the eight floor shortly after 1:00, and got to take a short nap before dinner.&nbsp; A little real food in her system helped cheer her up a bit, and then she let me cuddle with her in her bed while we watched some TV (her favorite show: DC Super Hero Girls) until those little eyes couldn&rsquo;t stay open any longer around 8:00.&nbsp; As Caron and I both do with Amber just before she falls asleep, we said the Rosary, and she is now in a deep, peaceful sleep.</p>
<p>And as I sit here next to her bed, writing this blog post, watching my beautiful little angel snooze, I thank God for this time with her.&nbsp; We have a sense of some of the major challenges ahead of us, but we don&rsquo;t know what the future will be.&nbsp; We do know, however, what the past 6+ weeks have been, and what could have happened.&nbsp; Dragons or not, we are going to&nbsp;appreciate every day we get with our family.</p>

		<p>Amber is out of surgery, and is resting comfortably in the PICU. Everything went well &ndash; both the port and the skull flap procedures were successful, with nothing unexpected. She&rsquo;ll remain in the PICU overnight, and be back up to the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; room tomorrow afternoon. But now the PICU is far less terrifying than when we were here before, and we have some very friendly and familiar faces taking care of us (we are with Nurse Alex right now, one of our favorites).</p>
<p>And, at Amber&rsquo;s request, the surgeons also took care of her doll, Lily. Lily also did well, also getting both a port and a skull flap, and is resting comfortably with Amber. And you if you look close, you&rsquo;ll see that Cutie, Lily&rsquo;s teddy bear, also received some surgical attention.</p>

<p>Now for some simple R&amp;R, a normal food menu for dinner tonight, then we get back to the PT/OT maybe tomorrow (or Saturday), and keep working toward getting home &hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you, God, for bringing Amber through today&rsquo;s surgery so well. And thank you to the large team of folks here at CCMC taking such good care of her.</p>

		<p>Today ends our sixth week of this journey, this epic rollercoaster. While we realize we are not the first ones to have followed this path, we also recognize that it is not a common path that everyone finds themself on. We also recognize that the vast amount of support we&rsquo;ve received, of prayer being offered for Amber, of love being expressed for our family, is not something that all on this path are fortunate enough to receive. We are truly appreciative for this blessing, and know that there will be a time in the future where we will be able to pay this forward ourselves.</p>
<p>Today was another busy day. I wake up this morning in Amber&rsquo;s room, and see Amber starting to wake too. I see Amber shifting her legs around, bouncing them up and down a bit. Noting that this is before my first coffee of the day, it takes me a moment to realize that I used the word &ldquo;legs&rdquo;, in plural. While Amber has been able to muster some hip movement, and swing that left leg into a few steps before, this was different &ndash; the hip, the knee, the ankle were all moving, in sync. By the end of today, we had Amber walk almost 30 feet down the hall, with her leg brace and walker supporting her, and the therapist providing balance. That leg is rapidly coming back to strength at a pace surprising to even the therapists. We still have a lot of work on that left leg, but wow &ndash; incredible progress.</p>
<p>Still much work to do with the left arm too. Little intentional movement still, but &ldquo;little&rdquo; is far better than &ldquo;zero&rdquo;. The race, as I see it, is to see how much ground we can gain before we start the radiation treatment, which is now two weeks away. I expect that her physical recovery will slow when she is also undergoing these treatments. But again, &ldquo;slow&rdquo; is also far better than &ldquo;stop&rdquo;, and we will work with Amber for as long as it takes.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is a big day. Amber&rsquo;s surgery to replace the skull flap and install a port is scheduled for 8:40AM &ndash; 1:00 PM, and she will recover in the ICU for the following 24 hours before returning to our normal room. All signs point toward a smooth, standard procedure. But please, we ask for prayer for a successful surgery, for the surgeons performing the surgery, for a rapid recovery, and for continued progress. We will post an update here as soon as we can after the surgery.</p>
<p>If all goes well tomorrow, we are hopeful for a return home next week!</p>

		<p>(Warning: long but positive post ahead)</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not brain surgery at all &mdash; as far as anyone can tell, the MRI shows no tumor regrowth, so Thursday&rsquo;s surgery will &ldquo;just&rdquo; be reinstallation of the skull flap, and no additional surgery to do anything to the brain is necessary!</p>
<p>This really is about as good as we could have hoped for, so we are celebrating this news!</p>
<p>As Dr. Martin was explaining the MRI results to us this morning, it struck me how he talks about the brain, about the surgical process. Clearly, he has been doing this for a while, so I joked with him that he makes this sound &ldquo;simple&rdquo;. His reply was a witty &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s not quite rocket science!&rdquo; And then he pointed me to this Brain Surgeon sketch on Youtube &ndash; it&rsquo;s a good laugh, worth 2 minutes to watch.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THNPmhBl-8I]</p>
<p>Starting off with this good news, the day just seemed to accelerate from there.</p>
<p>We met with the Radiation Oncologist from Hartford Hospital, who will be coordinating the radiation therapy for Amber. We will be meeting with her to start the process next Thursday, and immediately jumping into 6 weeks of daily radiation treatments. Nicely enough, she is looking to coordinate with our local hospital (Backus in Norwich), so that we can receive the treatments with only a 15 minute drive, instead of 50 minutes up to Hartford!</p>
<p>Of course, receiving the treatments in Norwich only makes sense if Amber is back home &hellip; and we are indeed talking about bringing her home in the near future! We will assess things after this Thursday&rsquo;s surgery, but if everything looks good, and PT/OT say she is ready, then we may be looking at next week! So the discharge nurse came and introduced herself, and started discussion with us about the equipment and supplies we&rsquo;ll need. After 41 days here in CCMC, it&rsquo;s weird to think about being back home, but this will a great boost to Amber&rsquo;s emotional health.</p>
<p>And then with PT today, Amber got to try out that <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/30/day-40-bracing-ourselves/">new leg brace</a>, and was able to stand on her own two legs, with no support from anyone else (though we were all within 1/2 inch of her just in case, of course). After some exhausting exercise, we got a new wheel chair to prepare for home. A simple wheel chair, striking because of the symbolism &ndash; we no longer need all the crazy straps and supports of the one Amber has been using up to this point. We also got a walker for her, to continue exercising those legs until she no longer needs the assistance.</p>
<p>We then put the new wheelchair to good use, with a trip outside. Sunny, breezy, beautiful. Just what Amber (and I) needed.</p>
<p>We wrapped up the day with some family visitors, which kept Amber in high spirits. I&rsquo;m hoping the food they brought for me wasn&rsquo;t meant to be shared with Caron, because I destroyed the whole tray in one sitting.</p>
<p>By the way &ndash; thank you to those who commented here or reached out to us directly to suggest a port as a resolution to the challenges with the IV. That reminded me to discuss with the doctors here, as we had previously discussed a port as having application for some of the cancer treatments in the future. From today&rsquo;s conversations, everyone has agreed that a port will be inserted during the surgery this Thursday, instead of during a separate surgery later. And my little girl has had more than enough procedures over the past 41 days, so we&rsquo;re very happy to avoid additional surgeries!</p>
<p>So today is a day of thanks. Thanks to all of you who have been praying for Amber, thanks to the Doctors, Nurses, and all of the staff here at CCMC and at Backus hospital for getting us this far and putting us on a path toward recovery, and thanks to God for helping Amber stay strong, body and soul. The support for Amber has been overwhelming. The community of people that we have learned are praying for Amber, from many Churches, many schools, many organizations, is overwhelming. The personal notes we&rsquo;ve received, privately and in the comments of this blog, from others who have gone through their own health battles, especially those with cancer experiences, has been incredibly touching. We are truly blessed to have this support for Amber.</p>
<p>But we are far from done. We continue to make great progress on <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/03/day-13-the-elephant-and-the-whale/">the Elephant</a>, as Amber continues to work hard to recover from the stroke. But <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/03/day-13-the-elephant-and-the-whale/">the Whale</a> is looming larger than ever now, becoming more real to us as we have formally scheduled the beginning of the cancer treatment. And let&rsquo;s be very, very realistic &ndash; battling Glioblastoma Multiforme is going to be very, very hard. We are preparing to put everything we have and more into this fight. We will do whatever is necessary to see Amber through this.</p>
<p>So we ask for continued prayer. We ask for prayers for Amber, that she may continue to gain strength and progress toward a healthy future. And we ask for prayers for the medical professionals providing for Amber&rsquo;s care, that they may be blessed for the work they do, and that they continue to have the knowledge, clarity, and will to propel Amber toward health.</p>
