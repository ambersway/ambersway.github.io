	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Praying for Successful radiation treatments for Amber....<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I’m asking myself the same questions, will I ever wake up from this nightmare &#038; have my son back, as he was, just a few short months ago...<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f622.png" alt="😢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.  Sometimes I can’t even breath from my hurting heart. My son is 34 years old with a similar diagnosis....

He is 6 weeks past his 30 days of radiation &#038; Chemo (by pill for 40 days)...He started his 2nd phase of Chemo (by pill) today....5 days on, 23 days off for 6 months....

For now, I live for just today &#038; especially my Fridays when I venture to MA to spend the day with him &#038; his beautiful wife <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />


Please know your blog on Amber’s journey is very helpful to me. She is in my prayers daily<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
