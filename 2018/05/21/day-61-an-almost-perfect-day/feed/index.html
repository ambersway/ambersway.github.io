	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way – with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[She&#8217;s had to fight so hard these past months.  And to have to come to terms with so much at a young age!  We cant even begin to know unless you&#8217;ve truly been there.   Tears of frustration and sadness knowing how she woke up and everything was different.  But tears can be so healing and don&#8217;t we do them where we are safe to let our guard down?  Ambers home is a beautiful place for her right now with all these medical appointments!  Where she can vent and share her fear, her loss.  Super Amber Grace,  you are not alone sweet girl!  Our entire school loves and misses you so much! And Jesus cried so it&#8217;s ok for us to as well.   Tears say more than words ever could!

					<description><![CDATA[And that’s how it unfolds. Everybody, everybody has a “down” day when dealing with something as overwhelming as this. You hold each other up on the “down” days and keep moving. Amber (despite being extraordinary) is just a little girl; her frustration and fear must be enormous.
Hugs and ice cream sandwiches are really the best medicine on “down” days.]]></description>
