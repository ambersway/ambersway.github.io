	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

					<description><![CDATA[My heart goes out to you Matt and Caron as you watch Amber go through all this. She‚Äôs amazing!  God is helping her deal with all of this, it‚Äôs evident.  You are going one day, one moment at a time.  That‚Äôs all one can handle.  My prayers continue.  For her, for you, for your kiddos and the extended family!  And for Amber‚Äôs friends too!]]></description>
