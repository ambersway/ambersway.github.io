		<p>Never in my life did I think that I would be in a situation where <em><span style="color:#333333;">(A)</span></em> I would have to bring my youngest daughter for radiation treatments because she actually has cancer and <em><span style="color:#333333;">(B)</span></em>&nbsp;I am actually sad that today is Amber&rsquo;s last day of treatment.&nbsp; Crazy, I know.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; Cancer sucks.&nbsp; Radiation sucks.&nbsp; However, the radiation crew at Backus Hospital in Norwich, they made it not suck.&nbsp; In fact, the emotion that I am physically having right now is a feeling of love, happiness, and admiration for the folks in the radiation department.</p>
<p>From the start of this part of Amber&rsquo;s journey (the radiation treatments) this department has welcomed us with open and loving arms, and took us under their wings.&nbsp; All throughout her 30 treatments, they have treated Amber like a family member, not &ldquo;just&rdquo; a patient.&nbsp; But their kindness did not stop at just Amber.&nbsp; They were so thoughtful and sweet towards Ryan, Brianna, Marie, and Matt and me.&nbsp; They certainly went above and beyond.&nbsp; And for me, personally, since I was the one that mainly brought Amber to her appointments every day since May 17th, the radiation crew made me feel &ldquo;human&rdquo; again.&nbsp; With the way these past 3 months have been, it was nice to have people (<em>who didn&rsquo;t even know me</em>) take interest in me and my well being, making sure that <em><strong><span style="color:#333333;">I</span></strong></em> was doing okay.&nbsp; But not just checking in on my sanity &mdash; actually taking the time to talk with me and ask how my weekend was or how my day was going or making me laugh.&nbsp; I honestly did not know going into this that I would be this torn inside with my feelings and emotions on Amber&rsquo;s final day today.&nbsp; The kindness and love from a group of individuals that did not even know us at first, but wanted to get to know us, day after day &mdash; it blossomed into an awesome friendship.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" size-full wp-image-547 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radiation-crew-e1530224470849.jpg" alt="radiation-crew.jpg" width="432" height="324" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radiation-crew-e1530224470849.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radiation-crew-e1530224470849-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"></p>
<p>And even more, the other patients at radiation &mdash; what a beautiful group of people.&nbsp; Sharing in something so sad and somber with Amber but also perhaps (hopefully) having their spirits lifted when they saw her; her positive progression, her smile, and her laugh each week.&nbsp; I hope seeing Amber in these ways gives a sense of <span style="color:#333333;">Hope</span> for those that especially need it right now.</p>
<p>So in short (too late) &mdash; Radiation itself sucks but the people that we&rsquo;ve come to know at radiation, they totally rock!&nbsp; A truly <span style="color:#333333;">Bittersweet</span> moment for sure.</p>
<p>So God did it again.&nbsp; HE made something that has been so life-changing and at some points devastating, and He turned it into something wonderful.&nbsp; He put us in another situation that we were <span style="color:#333333;"><em>meant</em></span> to be in . . . brought strangers together to become lifetime friends.</p>
<p>Why God has put us together specifically with these lovely wonderful people from our time during radiation . . . well, I haven&rsquo;t figured it out, <em>yet</em>.&nbsp; But it is certain that HIS plan for Amber (and us) continues on.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s way is Amber&rsquo;s way and we just have to be patient to see where it leads us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; On a side note, un-radiation related, as I was triple checking this post and adding/changing its content, Amber&rsquo;s loose tooth came out &mdash; not by her pulling it by fingers mind you, but by way of her tongue pushing it out!&nbsp; This is Amber&rsquo;s 1st tooth!!!!!</p>

		<p>This past week has proven to be yet another new &ldquo;New Normal&rdquo; for the Smith household.&nbsp; The girls were officially done for summer two Fridays ago, and normally the schedule we once had diminishes and we have to readjust to a new summer schedule.&nbsp; So the same is obviously true for this year too, however, add in Amber&rsquo;s many appointments and her &ldquo;at home duties&rdquo; to the mix and it&rsquo;s just plain chaos.&nbsp; Thank God, literally, for grandparents because without the help of them, I would be in the loony bin.&nbsp; Suffice to say, we made it through the week not too bruised or battered!&nbsp; <em>(it&rsquo;s funny how life has a way of doing that&hellip;)</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-542 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435.jpg?w=190" alt="Am2" width="190" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435.jpg 713w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435-190x300.jpg 190w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435-648x1024.jpg 648w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px">In between all the chaos of this past week, I have to say that Super Amber Grace, is&nbsp;walking . . . by herself mind you, all over the place, and quite well.&nbsp; And, when she&rsquo;s been sitting and is bored with it, she gets up out of her sitting place and walks around, just because.&nbsp; Walks to any place she can.&nbsp; And when we ask her where she&rsquo;s walking to she just says &ldquo;just around, I gotta get my PT in&rdquo;!&nbsp; Well alrighty then &mdash; how can we argue with that?&nbsp; I mean seriously!!!</p>
<p>At the beginning of last week, Amber and I met with an APRN named Victoria from Dr. Gillan&rsquo;s Oncology group and then Dr. Martin from Neurosurgery for some routine follow ups.&nbsp; Everything was good.&nbsp; One thing that was discussed at both appointments (and then later was confirmed) was Amber&rsquo;s next MRI, or as I like to call it (and I believe it was Dr. Martin <em>way</em> <em>back</em> in the beginning who called it), &ldquo;<strong>The Truth Machine</strong>&ldquo;,&nbsp; which is scheduled for Wednesday, July 25th, 2018.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when we learn the truth of what&rsquo;s happening inside Amber&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>And . . . I am scared out of my mind, but in a numb kind of way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the kind of physical feeling of combining the emotional feeling of actually being scared but mixed with my mind consciously saying &ldquo;it is what it is&rdquo;.&nbsp; Kind of like that giving up feeling.&nbsp; Because in truth, <em>it is what it is</em>.&nbsp; Amber&rsquo;s outcome is either:&nbsp; status quo, no regrowth or:&nbsp; bad, there are more tumors lurking.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;ve been praying like crazy and saying the Rosary every night asking for the impossible &mdash; for Amber to be completely healed and cured of cancer . . . but, what if it <em><span style="color:#333333;">was</span></em> possible?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what <span style="color:#333333;">Hope</span> is, right?</p>
<p>Please, if you can, say an extra prayer for Amber &mdash; especially as we near July 25th.&nbsp; As I&rsquo;ve said in the past, I truly and wholeheartedly believe in the power of prayer &mdash; it&rsquo;s been made apparent to me, especially over these past 3 months.&nbsp; And also, please don&rsquo;t get annoyed with me as we get closer to her MRI date when I keep asking, and asking, and asking,&nbsp; for you to say an extra prayer for Amber.&nbsp; My father used to tell me I was really good at nagging him when I was a kid.&nbsp; My husband loves to tell me that I am the best at nagging him to death to get things done around the house and geez, don&rsquo;t even get me started on what my kids thing of my nagging!&nbsp; What can I say &mdash; it&rsquo;s a gift and a curse!</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp; &#128578;</p>

<p>As we have done every year for the past many years, today on Father&rsquo;s Day we went for a nice nature walk.&nbsp; We drove up past the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comstock's_Bridge">Comstock Covered Bridge</a> in Colchester, CT to a secluded parking area along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Line_State_Park_Trail">Airline Trail</a>, which is an old railroad line converted to a beautiful trail perfect for walking, running, and biking.</p>
<p>Knowing that Amber isn&rsquo;t quite ready for such a long walk, we dug out the old jogging stroller for her, which worked out well.&nbsp; In total, the family walked about a mile out on the trail, and a mile back, with a stop for snacks midway.&nbsp; It was sunny and hot, but enough shade all along to make it a wonderful way to spend the time.</p>
<p>Of course, thinking back to the 50 days spent in the hospital, and what we&rsquo;ve gone through over the past 3 months, I am very thankful to have my whole family with me today.&nbsp; But even more noteworthy for today was Amber&rsquo;s determination to get out of the stroller and walk.</p>
<p>The trail is very well maintained, but it is still a trail.&nbsp; Loose dirt and gravel is not nearly as level and stable as a wooden or linoleum floor.&nbsp; But Amber wanted to walk, and so she did.&nbsp; With nothing more than holding either my hand or Caron&rsquo;s hand, Amber walked about a mile of the trek, in two half-mile spurts with a break in between.&nbsp; Not even two months ago, Amber took <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/26/day-36-tiny-but-mighty-steps/">her first steps</a>&nbsp;after 36 days in the hospital, and was exhausted by a yard of walking.&nbsp; Now, she is up to a half-mile at a time!&nbsp; Yes, she is still working on her balance, but that too is getting better, as she walks around the house (with us hovering within inches) unassisted.&nbsp; This 6-year-old&rsquo;s determination is impressive!</p>
<p>And so I pray that her determination, her motivation continues.&nbsp; I pray for her left leg and foot, her left arm and hand to continue to regain their strength.&nbsp; I pray that she be cured of the cancer, that no tumors return, that there are no other developments that threaten her longevity.</p>
<p>But most of all, regardless of long-term outcome, I pray that God keeps her happy &mdash; just as she was today, holding my hand as I walked alongside her; as she put the effort, the focus into her journey today, one step at a time, and I provided her whatever support she needed on her way.</p>
<p>Yes, today&rsquo;s walk was rather symbolic for me.</p>

		<p>As Amber gets stronger and improves everyday I can&rsquo;t help but ponder (again) what the future holds for her.</p>
<p>This past month, although going great with Amber&rsquo;s positive improvements with things like walking on her own and &ldquo;lefty&rdquo; (which is her left arm, hand, and fingers) getting stronger, I can&rsquo;t help but feel sad.</p>
<p>About a month ago we suddenly lost our daycare provider at Saint Joseph School.&nbsp; A gentle soul of a woman who clearly cared for the children she was watching over.&nbsp; And then almost a week ago, we lost another wonderful woman whose grandchildren attend Saint Joseph School.&nbsp; This particular woman was diagnosed with an illness not unlike Amber&rsquo;s around the same time that we found out about Amber&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That was 3 months ago (in a few days &mdash; June 21st).&nbsp; The first woman was sudden, and the second, although not as &ldquo;sudden&rdquo;, was also too soon.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help but think about Amber in all this.&nbsp; What does this mean for her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid to think of what this means for Amber, given the type of cancer she has where the outlook is particularly grim.&nbsp; I guess it just puts life once again into perspective.&nbsp; <em>Cherish</em> it, <em>Enjoy</em> it . . .&nbsp; while we still can.&nbsp; Life is precious &mdash; which is making itself very clear to me, especially with the passing of these two wonderful women.&nbsp; I know it sounds so cliche to &ldquo;live life to the fullest&rdquo; but do we?&nbsp; With the mundane nuances of the &ldquo;same old same old&rdquo; day to day living, are we really living our life to the fullest?&nbsp; To actually remember that our life, and the lives of our loved ones around us, are not going to be here on Earth forever.&nbsp; To think that they actually may be gone tomorrow . . .&nbsp; that&rsquo;s a hard concept to digest and that&rsquo;s a hard concept to actually consciously think about, every . . . single . . . day . . .</p>
<p>Our own mortality.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it make life so much less complicated if we knew when our time was up?&nbsp; Well, for someone like Amber, with the type of cancer she has, hers might be predictable . . . but the doctors are working hard to change that, and&nbsp;we pray for Divine Intervention for her to be Blessed Stanley Rother&rsquo;s Miracle!&nbsp; I am optimistic for Amber but I am also realistic . . .</p>
<p>If you had a hard day, or a boring day, or even a great day today, give your loved ones an extra squeeze when you are hugging them and an &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, because remember, we never know when that may be our last one to give.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that a month ago on May 10th, we came home from the hospital!  Here it is June 10th (already) and it&rsquo;s getting to the point where our 50 long days of being in the hospital are beginning to take on that foggy distant memory type of feeling, fading a little bit more with each new day.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening we took the family to Holy Trinity Church in Hartford for Mass.  Holy Trinity is where Matt and I went weekly while Amber was in the hospital &mdash; a very much needed healing spot for the two of us to go and take a break, even if only for an hour, to be able to reflect, breathe, and refresh our souls during such a turbulent time in our lives.  Holy Trinity is <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/03/30/father-charlie-a-blessed/">Father Charlie</a>&lsquo;s church, and while Amber has met Father Charlie in the hospital, she has not seen his church, and has been asking weekly to go and visit.  Father Charlie has not seen Amber out of her hospital bed, hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunity to see her talking or walking, and so we have been anticipating this visit for quite some time.  We were very excited to not only see Father Charlie but the parishioners as well because we knew that they have all been praying for Amber and our family.</p>
<p>Right before Mass, Father Charlie comes right over to see us, to see Amber, with a big hug for each of us.  He cannot take his eyes off Amber and keeps remarking about her being a miracle.  And then, during his sermon; talking about Veronica and Simon&rsquo;s aid to Jesus as he carried the Cross, he calls across the church &ldquo;Matt, Matt, would you be willing to tell us Amber&rsquo;s story, at the end of Mass?&rdquo;.  It occurred to us that this Church, this new part of our community, has helped us carry our Cross, and has helped Amber carry hers. Of course we would share the whole story with them.  And so, after Communion and before the Recessional Hymn, Father invited our whole family up to the front, and Matt had the opportunity to address the Church.  He talked about a few of our personal experiences, as well as emphasizing how hard it has been to accept that, as &ldquo;The Dad&rdquo;, he can&rsquo;t just fix this by just working harder or longer, and therefore has to put his faith in those that can fix this; in Amber&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s putting trust in the doctors, nurses, and the people around us, and having faith that God brought us to them for a reason.  Matt also made a point that you just don&rsquo;t know if you can lift 300 pounds until you try, and in the same way, we didn&rsquo;t know the strength of our faith until this test.</p>
<p>After applause and some tears, we headed back down to the pews where we finished Mass.  Before leaving, we had many of the parishioners come up to us with kinds words and hugs.  Holy Trinity has become a part of our community, our family in support of Amber &mdash; Our Church away from Church.</p>
<p>And after that, we said our farewell to Father Charlie and headed out for dinner at a spot we would often hit after Church, J&rsquo;s Restaurant &mdash; another thing we HAD to do now that we had Amber with us!  A celebration for sure!</p>
<p>It is so comforting to know that we have people cheering, praying, and rallying for Amber and our family.  Amber has her army behind her helping her fight this battle, and it&rsquo;s her battle that will be won, on her terms, in her way.</p>

		<p>Yesterday Amber had her first official Physical Therapy appointment since being in the hospital. Our new physical therapist&rsquo;s name is Elyce. As soon as we walked into her therapy room, Amber got excited because there, hanging in the middle of the room, was a swing! So while I caught Elyce up on Amber&rsquo;s sudden life changing situation, Amber got to swing.  Afterwards, Elyce had Amber on the floor rolling to get from point A to point B, which she did but it only lasted the one time because Amber&rsquo;s G-Tube button was sore.  Next Elyce had Amber pulling herself up to tall kneeling and then walking on her knees. Amber fell a couple times (on a mat) but got right back up and tried again. We ended up going over our session time with Elyce which I felt bad about but also, on the other hand, selfishly, I was glad it did because it was satisfying seeing Amber working so hard with a professional (in other words, not me trying to figure out what to do!).  And as an added bonus, at the end of the session, Elyce allowed us to borrow a square roller scooter to take home and practice for the week (which all of us have been thoroughly enjoying!).</p>
<p>Just as soon as we got home and I dropped Amber with her grandparents, I ran down to the school to help with decorating for the eighth grader&rsquo;s class night. Then I ran back home to grab Amber for radiation.  After radiation it was back home where both of the littlest ones went down for naps and I had just enough time do a couple things before getting Marie off the bus.  Shortly after that I ran to pick Brianna up from choir, helped her with her homework, got the littlest ones up from naps and made sure Marie was ready for Class Night, where she and her classmates were going to host the eighth graders.  My plan was to essentially just drop off Marie, only stopping briefly to say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; and then get the rest of the kids home for dinner than bed.  However, I was informed that I may want to hang around for the beginning part of the ceremony &mdash; which I am so glad we did!  Little did I know that after prayers and introductions, the eighth grade class got up and announced that this years year book was dedicated to Amber!   What a thoughtful and sweet gesture by the eighth grade class!  Our school, like Amber, may be small but man oh man, in the same vein, like Amber, boy is it <i><b>MIGHTY</b></i>!  A BIG Thank you to the eighth grade graduation class for the honor of dedicating your 2018 year book to Amber &mdash; that touched us immensely, and personally made my very long crazy day, much more special and worthwhile!</p>

		<p>Wow, what a busy day today!</p>
<p>We were out the door by 7:20 this morning, for a 7:45 radiation treatment.  Only 18 treatments left to go!  It&rsquo;s funny &ndash; as horrific as it is to have my 6-year old go through radiation treatments, the team at Backus is so nice, so good to Amber, so good to <i>us</i>, that it doesn&rsquo;t feel as bad as it should.  I guess that&rsquo;s a good thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s just the dichotomy that strikes me so much.</p>
<p>Then off to Children&rsquo;s Medical Center in Hartford for a 10:30 check-in.  By noon, Amber had her new g-tube in place, and had a couple dozen stiches removed from her scalp. All those <i>Stinkin&rsquo; Stiches</i>, as she liked to call them, are gone &ndash; and she is healing up really well.  Again, the contrast between the very visible healing of her scalp and the unknown of what the GBM may be doing inside her her head strikes me deeply.</p>
<p>And then, after sleeping off the sedation for almost 2 hours, we headed upstairs for a combo visit with Oncology and Nutrition.  Amber&rsquo;s weight is doing <i>very</i> well, so we are starting to cut down the supplemental overnight feed. Even after the sedation and procedure, Amber was asking for a snack, so there are definitely no appetite challenges there! And no changes with Oncology, continuing the course with radiation until the end of June.</p>
<p>So we continue with this new status quo, each step showing positive progress, taking progressive bites of the whale (with much of the elephant carcass now behind us), but knowing that we are far from out of the woods.  We pray to be shown that path out of the woods, no matter how many twists in that path, and no matter how often we stumble.</p>

		<p>Tomorrow is a big day, one that Amber&rsquo;s been looking forward to for quite a while &mdash; she&rsquo;s having her &ldquo;SS&rsquo;s&rdquo; removed; her &ldquo;Stinkin&rsquo; Stitches&rdquo;. She will also have her G-Tube replaced. And, we&rsquo;ll be meeting with Dr.Martin (NeuroSurg), Dr. Gillan (Oncology) and Dakota (Nutritionist). Big day indeed, especially with our day starting with an early trip to radiation.&nbsp; And after tomorrow&rsquo;s radiation visit, there will be &ldquo;only&rdquo; 18 more to go.</p>
<p>This past Friday we met with Michelle, Maura, and student McKenzie for OT.&nbsp; Right off the bat, Michelle and Maura immediately noticed how much looser Amber&rsquo;s left arm and hand were. They also couldn&rsquo;t believe how Amber&rsquo;s hand and fingers were loose and not in a tight fist.&nbsp; So any talk of having her wear a splint at night was now thrown out the window!&nbsp; The ladies were amazed at Amber&rsquo;s progress, but I wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; In my heart as they were assessing Amber and commenting on her positive progress, I just wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;shocked&rdquo;. Yes of course it&rsquo;s because Matt and I are helping Amber with some exercises, and yes it&rsquo;s Amber herself working hard, but it&rsquo;s <i>more</i> than that. It&rsquo;s <i>bigger</i> than that. It&rsquo;s all the healing prayers and healing thoughts for her.</p>
<p>When we got done with radiation on Friday and were walking back into the waiting area, a stranger started chatting with Amber and I.&nbsp; This simple pleasantry turned into something special and very generous for Amber.&nbsp; What this kind stranger did was something that touched my heart so deeply that I nearly lost it with a flood of tears.</p>
<p>What posses a complete stranger to do something spontaneous from the heart that is so sincere, guileless and unselfish?&nbsp; A bond.&nbsp; It was an instant unlikely bond between him and Amber; an older man that has lived almost all of his life and an innocent little girl that is just starting hers, yet both possibly doomed by the same uncompromising disease. A special bond that only a certain few share.&nbsp; Amber didn&rsquo;t see it but I did; a brief moment in time where both <em>beautiful</em> and <em>sad</em> collided.</p>
<p>To that kind stranger that is now a forever friend, thank you. Thank you for changing my life in more ways than you know.</p>
