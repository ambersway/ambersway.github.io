	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the Moana outfit!  Love you all.  Never think that you&#8217;re nagging us for extra prayers.  It&#8217;s because of Amber&#8217;s journey I have found my faith.  I haven&#8217;t stopped praying and won&#8217;t.  Love you all!
