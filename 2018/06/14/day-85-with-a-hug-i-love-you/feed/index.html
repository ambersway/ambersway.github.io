	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful entry, Caron!  We must appreciate each and every day that God gives us as we never know when He will call us home.  It was quite a shock when Mrs. King passed away, such a loving and caring person, so quiet and unassuming.  We have prayed every day for her and her family. Also, losing another one of our grandmothers, Mrs. Moriarty, also hit home, also  a very loving and caring person.  Again, we have prayed for her and her family as well.
We have prayed every day for Amber and all of  you as this has been quite the journey for you. I believe that Amber has experienced many small miracles and will continue to experience even more.  She has so much going for her and she works so hard at her recovery &#8211; she is just one amazing girl!

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you. My grandmother loved Amber and the whole family. She was very proud of Amber. She would have been so happy to see Amber getting the yearbook. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
