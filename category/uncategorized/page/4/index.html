We're going to make this journey in Amber's Way &ndash; with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</h2>

		<p>The MRI results today did show &ldquo;recurrence&rdquo; &ndash; some regrowth of the tumor.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn&rsquo;t the news we&rsquo;ve been hoping and praying for. At the same time, though, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ve lost the war. The regrowth is fairly small, and we know where it is and what we are dealing with. Over the next week, we&rsquo;ll review options (some of which are already in motion), make decisions, and move forward with treatment. When I think back almost 6 months to the beginning of this journey, we are in a much better position now than then.</p>
<p>We have been preparing ourselves for this possibility. But it still hurts, a lot. This is not what any of us wanted. As her father, I just want to take this from her &ndash; my six year old daughter should not have to go through this. But, we also haven&rsquo;t been fooling ourselves, we knew that recurrence was likely, this type of cancer (GBM) doesn&rsquo;t go down without a fight. We are prepared for ongoing battle.</p>
<p>The next step is another MRI, looking at the spine to make sure this thing hasn&rsquo;t spread.&nbsp; This hasn&rsquo;t been scheduled yet, but should be early next week.&nbsp; This will help determine which of the potential next steps we are going to pursue.</p>
<p>I am so appreciative for Dr. Gillan and Dr. Martin (and all the innumerable staff that we&rsquo;ve met at CCMC). They are very direct, yet sympathetic. They understand what kind of detail we need to hear, and how to convey it so we can understand it. They care about Amber, and about us. We know that we were brought to them for a reason, and that they are fighting this battle with us.</p>
<p>And we continue to be amazed at The Good that has come from this journey, in the community that has formed around Amber and the impact we have been told she has had on others.</p>
<p>And so we continue to pray, and ask for prayers for Amber and the medical professionals helping her. We continue to work with Amber on her physical recovery from the stroke (her progress continues to be incredible), and continue to attack this cancer with everything we have. And we&rsquo;ll just keep moving forward, one step at a time.</p>

		<p>Sometimes the thought of why we pray comes across my mind.&nbsp; For me, praying is the natural thing to do when something is heavy on my heart or I want to give thanks to God.&nbsp; In praying I find there is Hope.&nbsp; Hope, when all else feels lost.&nbsp; Prayer for me is a direct connection with God, and it fills my soul with a sense of comfort and encouragement.</p>
<p>I know that Amber is a strong, determined, feisty girl.&nbsp; I know how strong she is, I&rsquo;ve seen her, (and still do see her), in action.&nbsp; However, I truly believe in my soul and in my heart that Amber&rsquo;s strength and determination is nudged by all the prayers being said for her.&nbsp; I genuinely believe in prayer.&nbsp; The proof?&nbsp; Aside from the obvious &mdash; she is here with us, on Earth, after such <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/03/22/day-1-carons-morning/">a devastating start to this journey</a>&nbsp; &mdash;&nbsp; but the fact that she went back to her own school this past Monday.&nbsp; Saint Joseph School.&nbsp; More proof?&nbsp; The&nbsp;fact that she <em><strong>walked</strong></em> into her school, and <em><strong>talked</strong></em> with her friends, and <em><strong>did</strong></em> her class assignments.&nbsp; That my friends, is a miracle &mdash; all due to hard-work, determination, and . . .&nbsp;<strong>prayer</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 months ago, when this all first happened, I never would have thought I would be writing a post about Amber going back to school.&nbsp; At that time unfortunately, my thoughts were very grim.</p>
<figure id="attachment_626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-626" style="width: 432px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class=" size-full wp-image-626 alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bloga.jpg" alt="bloga" width="432" height="243" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bloga.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bloga-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-626" class="wp-caption-text">Amber on March 22nd, 2018</figcaption></figure>
<p>But this <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/27/day-37-superhero-day/">Supergirl</a> has made exceptional strides &mdash; leaps and bounds!&nbsp; Of course, she still has a bumpy road ahead.&nbsp; Regaining the parts of herself that are still weak and worse, continuing to fight the cancer within.&nbsp; However, with her continued perseverance she will succeed.&nbsp; Prayers have gotten us through the darkest of times and the happiest of times.&nbsp; And sometimes there will be situations where we will pray with a little more angst and passion.&nbsp; We have one of those coming up.&nbsp; This coming Friday, September 7th, is Amber&rsquo;s next MRI.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that with Amber&rsquo;s type of cancer there will always be the on-going threat of recurrence.&nbsp; I pray, and I ask you to pray, that <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/07/25/day-126-its-a-high-five-kind-of-day/">this cancer stays away</a>, that it continues to be in remission.&nbsp; So I ask of you, my friends and family, to please pray hard for Amber this upcoming Friday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a Holy Hour for her on <strong>Wednesday, September 5th at 7PM</strong>.&nbsp; Due to another heat-wave,&nbsp; the Holy Hour will be in held in the Chapel (where it is air-conditioned).&nbsp; The Chapel is located in between St. Mary&rsquo;s Church and The Academy of The Holy Family.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>The Make-A-Wish Foundation is an organization that grants &ldquo;wishes&rdquo; to children with life-threatening medical conditions.&nbsp; We have known about this organization prior to Amber because we have some family members that have had wishes granted.&nbsp; However, when I first heard that Make-A-Wish wanted to meet Amber and get to know her, I cringed.&nbsp; Thoughts like &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this is so serious that Make-A-Wish is contacting us&hellip;&rsquo; and the &lsquo;never thought it would happen to us&rsquo; went through my mind, and still does.&nbsp; The initial shock that, here we are, Matt and I, at this point in our lives where we are dealing with a child that is seriously sick is hard to swallow (still).&nbsp; But they really wanted to work with Amber and<a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/07/29/day-130-turns-out-this-week-was-pretty-awesome/"> grant her wish(es)</a>.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;re so glad they did.</p>
<p>Make-A-Wish is an absolute superb foundation.&nbsp; Hands Down.&nbsp; What I am about to share with you will have you understand why.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Aloha!</h1>
<p>Friday, August 10th, 2018 had us start off very very early by serenading our oldest daughter Marie with a &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; song, as she was turning 12 this very day.&nbsp; Later on we had our &ldquo;ride&rdquo; come pick us up to bring us to Logan Airport in Boston.&nbsp; Our ride turned out to be a beautiful black stretch limo!&nbsp; So big in fact that we told him to stay down by the road because our driveway would be too hard to maneuver with it being long and curvy.&nbsp; Amber needed no help as she climbed into the limo, beaming ear-to-ear!</p>
<figure id="attachment_604" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-604" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-604 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloga.jpg?w=300" alt="bloga" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloga.jpg 2100w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloga-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloga-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloga-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloga-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloga-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-604" class="wp-caption-text">Riding In Style!</figcaption></figure>
<p>After drop off at the airport, with our Make-A-Wish shirts on, we had some assistance from the JetBlue personnel helping us navigate through the security checkpoints and showing us to our specific gate where we waited for our plane.&nbsp; Now, this is all four of our children&rsquo;s first time at an airport and first time flying.&nbsp; It could have gone really <strong><em>really</em></strong> bad.&nbsp; But in fact, it went amazingly!&nbsp; They seemed like old pros!&nbsp; In fact, they did much better with all the travel (twelve hours in the air in each direction!) than most frequent fliers I know!</p>
<p>As we are on our descent into Honolulu, with the sunset casting its last shades of yellows and oranges, I started rousing Amber and Ryan as they have both fallen asleep on me.&nbsp; We gathered our goodies that were given to us special by the flight attendant because of our reason for being there that day as well as him getting to know Amber, and we head off the plane.&nbsp; As we were leaving, the pilot comes out to say hello and give the kids &ldquo;official&rdquo; passport books and their very own wings.&nbsp; As we were heading to our gate, Matt and a man he befriended on the plane, Officer Jones, were chatting and he tells us about how he&rsquo;s been serving our Country and that he is coming home to O&rsquo;ahu to see his baby girl and wife.&nbsp; He says he loves the Make-A-Wish Foundation and asks to take a picture with us.</p>
<figure id="attachment_605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-605" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-605 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogb.jpg?w=225" alt="blogb" width="225" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogb.jpg 288w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogb-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-605" class="wp-caption-text">Officially Got Our Leis</figcaption></figure>
<p>After we were done taking the picture, the flight attendants from our flight pass by and come over for a &ldquo;GROUP HUG&rdquo;!!!&nbsp; We all get in there for big hugs &mdash; and why not?&nbsp; We are all happy and in good spirits, how could you not be being in Hawai&rsquo;i?&nbsp; After officially getting our leis, we are whisked away to a van that is waiting to bring us to our hotel.&nbsp; It takes only about 40 minutes from the airport.&nbsp; I am surprised that everyone actually stays awake &ndash; because while it may be only 8PM in Hawai&rsquo;i, our bodies think it is 2AM CT time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s either the good naps most had or just the sheer excitement of us being in Hawai&rsquo;i and anticipation of getting to our resort, Disney&rsquo;s Aulani.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We arrive at Aulani and are greeted with more leis and really cool Menehune necklaces for the kids.&nbsp; Legend has it that the Menehune are little mythical pranksters in Hawai&rsquo;i but if you are wearing the necklace they will consider a you &ldquo;foa&rdquo; (friend) and not trick you.&nbsp; Ryan took this very seriously the whole week we were there!&nbsp; We are then brought up to our room.&nbsp; The room is spacious and beautiful.&nbsp; It has a kitchen with a full fridge, microwave, dishwasher, glassware, plates and utensils.&nbsp; A living room with a sofa that pulled out, a chair that pulled out, and a lanai.&nbsp; 2 bedrooms:&nbsp; the first having 2 queens with it&rsquo;s own bathroom and lanai, and the second being the master with a spacious bathroom with a jetted tub and walk in shower (with 2 shower heads!) and of course, our own private lanai.</p>
<figure id="attachment_606" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-606" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-606 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogc.jpg?w=300" alt="blogc" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogc.jpg 2100w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogc-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogc-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogc-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogc-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogc-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-606" class="wp-caption-text">Perfect View Of The Beautiful Ocean From Our Room</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to all this, there was also a 1/2 bath and a washer and dryer!&nbsp; Our lanais were perfect for seeing the picturesque ocean as well as Luaus!&nbsp; The Luaus were held right below us on the green.</p>
<p>Disney&rsquo;s Aulani Resort was themed like I would expect Hawai&rsquo;i to be &ndash;</p>
<figure id="attachment_620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-620" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-620" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogp.jpg?w=225" alt="blogp" width="225" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogp.jpg 288w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogp-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-620" class="wp-caption-text">Aulani Resort</figcaption></figure>
<p>very ornate, with lots of wooden/natural decor as well as beautifully hand painted Hawaiian wall murals that locals painted.&nbsp; The landscape was lush with tropical flowering plants and bushes, palm trees, koi ponds, and lit tiki torches at night. The resort had an abundance of pools, infinity pools, hot tubs, a lazy man river, water slides, and my favorite, access to the beautiful beach and Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It was hard to break away from the resort but sometimes we did.&nbsp; On our first full day there we spent a good amount of time down at the beach and then some water park time.&nbsp; After a while, it was time to leave for church.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-607" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogd.jpg?w=225" alt="blogd" width="225" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogd.jpg 288w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogd-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px">We hired a driver and he took us to Saint Jude Church in Kapolei.&nbsp; Saint Jude?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Talk about things that sometimes just make you go &ldquo;Hmm&rdquo;.&nbsp; Very fitting I would say!&nbsp; A very welcoming and friendly church and church community.</p>
<p>The next day (Sunday) was set up for us to visit a place called Sea Life Park.&nbsp; The drive was about an hour but totally worth it.&nbsp; The scenes that passed before my eyes were wonderful.&nbsp; Greenery, mountains, tropical plants and bushes, and of course the gorgeous coast line.&nbsp; I am very thankful for that long car ride because we got to see quite a bit of the the island of O&rsquo;ahu, even passing the famous Sandy Beach, with all the surfers in the water.&nbsp; Not sure if kids were too thrilled because the two oldest fell asleep!&nbsp; But Amber was glued to the window watching the scenery the whole way.</p>
<p>Sea Life Park is awesome!&nbsp; There was so much to do!&nbsp; We got to experience seeing ocean and animal life native to that part of the world.&nbsp; Sting rays, sharks, fish, dolphins, sea lions, penguins (yes, we saw penguins in Hawai&rsquo;i!) and birds.&nbsp; The aviary was the coolest and a favorite among Brianna and Marie. Inside the aviary, you got to pick up a popsicle stick with bird seed on it and feed the birds.&nbsp; We were in luck too, because sometimes, the birds would land on your stick so you could observe them up close and personal!</p>
<figure id="attachment_609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-609" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-609 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogf.jpg?w=200" alt="blogf" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogf.jpg 1400w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogf-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogf-683x1024.jpg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogf-768x1152.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogf-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogf-1365x2048.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-609" class="wp-caption-text">Scenery At Sea Life Park</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, what&rsquo;s even more lucky, is when the birds actually land on you like they did to both Brianna and Matt!&nbsp; So cool!&nbsp; As we were walking along and checking everything out you just had to stop and take in the views and the scenes because they were breathtaking.&nbsp; After an awesome dolphin show it was time for Amber and I to get into our bathing suits and go to the Dolphin Encounter, which was set up for us by Make-A-Wish.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-608" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloge.jpg?w=300" alt="bloge" width="300" height="226" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloge.jpg 1800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloge-300x226.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloge-1024x770.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloge-768x577.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bloge-1536x1155.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ask Amber what was one of her favorite parts about this vacation, she will tell you it was meeting the dolphin!&nbsp; It was the coolest thing ever!&nbsp; We got to pet, feed, kiss, get splashed by, and dance with a dolphin named Eanka!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_610" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-610" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-610 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogg.jpg?w=200" alt="blogg" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogg.jpg 1400w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogg-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogg-683x1024.jpg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogg-768x1152.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogg-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogg-1365x2048.jpg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-610" class="wp-caption-text">Meeting Moana</figcaption></figure>
<p>Later on in the week, Make-A-Wish set up a program for the children to attend called &ldquo;Fish are Friends&rdquo; where they got to make special fish food, feed the fish around the resort, and learn all about the native fish.&nbsp; The kids enjoyed making fish food and feeding the fish &ndash; but we had to chuckle when they told us it was too &ldquo;educational&rdquo; to do on vacation!!!</p>
<p>Throughout our vacation we had the opportunity to meet some Disney characters.&nbsp; Amber was really looking forward to meeting Moana, which we did, and Ryan was really looking forward to meeting Pluto, which he did!&nbsp; The kids also got to meet Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy.</p>
<p>One of the things that I was most looking forward to was being able to witness, first hand, a Hawaiian sunset.&nbsp; I have always heard about them but didn&rsquo;t think I would ever have the chance to see one.&nbsp; Now Matt can tell you that my thing is sunsets and sunrises.&nbsp; There is just something so special, and so glorious about them.&nbsp; The way the colors explode and cascade and melt together, it is truly a gift from God for us to witness.&nbsp; However, up until this point, I hadn&rsquo;t experienced that yet.&nbsp; And my evenings were coming to an end.&nbsp; I caught some sunsets over the first few days, and they were pretty, but . . . it wasn&rsquo;t <em>thee</em> Hawaiian sunset I had envisioned in my mind.&nbsp; Okay, so it&rsquo;s very possible that my expectations were either too high or maybe I was just in the wrong spot at the right time.&nbsp; And luckily for me, it was the latter.</p>
<p>After a day of water park activities in mostly cloudy weather, my expectations for catching a sunset this night was really low.&nbsp; It was my last potential night because tomorrow night, our last night, we had a Luau planned for the kids.&nbsp; So this night was my only opportunity.</p>
<figure id="attachment_613" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-613" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-613" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogj.jpg?w=300" alt="blogj" width="300" height="200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-613" class="wp-caption-text">Mer-Fairy, Amber Grace</figcaption></figure>
<p>At around 6PM that evening we took the kids down to the beach for some pictures.&nbsp; I wanted to get pictures of a beautiful-magical Mer-Fairy named Amber Grace (another wish she had) and her beautiful-magical sisters.&nbsp; As I was getting some shots, the clouds had parted away to let a bit of the sunset shine through.&nbsp; When we finished up, I felt a pang of let down.&nbsp; Again, the sunset was pretty but not what I was hoping.&nbsp; Matt suggested I walk down the opposite side of the beach to an area that had a curve around it with a hill and jutted out point &mdash; and boy am I glad!&nbsp; As I started walking down the beach towards the point, I had to stop, stare, and pull my camera out because it was so beautiful!&nbsp; <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-611 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogi.jpg?w=300" alt="blogi" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogi.jpg 2100w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogi-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogi-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogi-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogi-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogi-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">I grabbed Ryan&rsquo;s hand and we started walking further down and up the hill, even closer to the point and every so often I had to just stop, because literally, the words &ldquo;WOW&rdquo; came out of my mouth. THIS is what I wanted, this is what I had envisioned &mdash; NO &mdash;</p>
<figure id="attachment_612" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-612" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-612 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/blogh.jpg?w=200" alt="blogh" width="200" height="300"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-612" class="wp-caption-text">Thank You God</figcaption></figure>
<p>actually it was so much <strong>more</strong> than what I had envisioned . . . it was breathtaking and it was immaculate and it was glorious.&nbsp; To the point where once Ryan and I were at the top of the point watching this magnificent cascade of colors in front of us, I <strong>had</strong> to say a prayer to God.&nbsp; I had to thank him for <strong>everything</strong>;&nbsp; for this moment, for us being here in Hawai&rsquo;i, for Amber being alive today and here today with us; for Amber&rsquo;s health and that if somehow she could be miraculously healed and cured of cancer; and for my children and for my husband, and for all of the people on my prayer list that are in need of something right now.&nbsp; Thank you God for allowing me to witness such spectacular beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Towards the last day of our vacation, we found ourselves, once again, hooked up by Make-A-Wish with our own personal Meet and Greet with none other than Mickey Mouse himself!</p>

<p>We got to hang out (just us!) and get lots and lots of pictures with Mickey!&nbsp; Later on that evening, Matt and I took the kids to that infamous Luau we kept seeing from <em>way</em> up on our lanai.&nbsp; We totally had to check it out!&nbsp; I am so glad we did.&nbsp; It was so much fun!&nbsp; They had traditional Hawaiian fare as well as a show.&nbsp; The Hula dancers and story tellers did an amazing job of mesmerizing us with the music, songs, and stories of the Hawaiian people.&nbsp; In the story they tell of the history of Hawai&rsquo;i as well as what a deep impact our &ldquo;ohana&rdquo; (family) has in our lives and that Aloha does not only mean Hello and Goodbye but also the love that we hold inside of our hearts.&nbsp; And that is what we experienced this week in O&rsquo;ahu, Hawai&rsquo;i.&nbsp; The love that we hold in our hearts, especially when it comes to our family.&nbsp; And by the end of the night, Ryan was asleep in Matt&rsquo;s lap, and Amber enjoying the show in my lap.&nbsp; It was a beautiful way to end our trip, with our ohana.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make-A-Wish made a life-time of memories with this extraordinary trip to Hawai&rsquo;i.&nbsp; We are so blessed and so extremely grateful for their generosity.</p>
<hr>
<p>And now&hellip;it is back to reality.&nbsp; And reality being &mdash; SCHOOL STARTS TOMORROW!!!&nbsp; School starts tomorrow for <em><strong>everyone</strong></em>.&nbsp; I am so happy to announce that Amber will be going back to <strong><em>her</em></strong> school tomorrow, at Saint Joseph School!&nbsp; And also, because I said <em><strong>everyone</strong></em>, I also mean Ryan too.&nbsp; And as I am typing this, I am trying not to cry because my baby, Ryan, is actually starting Pre-K tomorrow.&nbsp; When did my baby get big enough to go to school?&nbsp; This is crazy right?&nbsp; Geesh!</p>
<p>Also, if you could please send positive thoughts and say extra prayers for Amber, her next MRI is scheduled for Friday, September 7th, 2018.</p>
<p>And lastly &mdash; a BIG ALOHA from our family to yours!!!</p>

		<p>Sunday, August 14th, 2016</p>
<p>It was 2 years ago, on this very day where Matt, the kiddos and I were celebrating our &ldquo;biggest and grandest&rdquo; summer family vacation yet &mdash; our first official trip to Walt Disney World with all 4 children! No cares in the world and the only thing we had to worry about is, what should we do next? And on this particular day, Sunday, August 14th 2016, was our extra special day because it was our Magic Kingdom Day. Extra special because before we could make our grand entrance to said Magic Kingdom, we had to prepare ourselves (and by ourselves I mean the children) appropriately. So, earlier that morning, we had all three of the ladies get all dolled up at The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. The pampering and primping took three already beautiful girls and transformed them into three beautiful princesses! And what of Ryan you ask? Don&rsquo;t you worry &mdash; I had him covered. He was transformed into Prince Ryan! Now we were ready for our official magical day to Magic Kingdom. And Magic it was . . . at first . . .</p>
<p>After meeting Ariel, Belle, and Cinderella, it was time to have an actual proper royal lunch at Cinderella&rsquo;s Royal Table where we would not only dine on delicious fancy foods but where we also got to meet so many other wonderful princesses. Towards the end of our royal lunch, Matt received a phone call and excused himself while the rest of us finished our delectable desserts. Unbeknownst to me, it was during this particular time frame that our magical world would burst.</p>
<p>2 Years ago on this day, Sunday August 14th, Matt&rsquo;s younger brother passed away unexpectedly. It was devastating and it was gut wrenching. When Matt pulled me aside, outside, after our special lunch to tell me the news, it felt as if someone poured ice water over my body. It made me numb. Still to this day it almost seems insanely comical that his passing happened on the same exact day where our family was celebrating in a place that is known as &ldquo;The Happiest Place on Earth&rdquo; &mdash; this happiest place on earth with all four of our children, surrounded by a glorious day of sunshine, laughter, and magic &mdash; now turned to darkness, crying, and sadness. It only takes seconds for a perfect situation to turn devastatingly awful.</p>
<p>Fast forward <i>almost</i> 2 years later . . .</p>
<p>On March 22, 2018 Amber had emergency brain surgery because of a previously unknown tumor that burst. I was too shocked to register anything at that time and knew I had to keep moving forward, for Amber&rsquo;s sake. Then, 4 days later, when Dr. Martin told us the results of the pathology report: Glioblasoma Multiforme, Grade 4 cancer; I physically felt (again) that same ice water being poured over my head and body, that same icey-numb feeling I felt when Matt told me about his brother . . . and if that wasn&rsquo;t a punch in the gut enough, hours later, Amber would be having her second brain surgery. For a family that has NEVER had as much as a broken anything &mdash; here is our youngest daughter having her SECOND brain surgery. Our family&rsquo;s lives have changed dramatically forever; our youngest daughter recovering from not only a left side weakness due to the massive stroke from the tumor but also, and worst of all, she is now a child with a life-threatening disease. A terrible and devastating situation. However, for devastating situations there are glimpses of hope and happiness. For Matt and I, we found our deeper Faith. We also found a community of family, friends, strangers that went out of their way to help us, support us, pray for us, and encourage us when Matt and I were in our darkest place. Now fast forward to today . . .</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 14th, 2018</p>
<p>And here is the Twist Of Fate. Two years ago it went from a magical perfect day to misery and grief. Today however, Amber&rsquo;s devastating situation brings us to paradise &mdash; O&rsquo;ahu, Hawai&rsquo;i (thanks to Make-a-Wish) and coincidentally enough, back to Disney. Although Amber&rsquo;s future is unknown to us, what we do know is that God has her here, with us, TODAY. And today, we happen to be in a place that seems to be as close as we can get to Heaven on Earth; golden sun, sea breeze with swaying palm trees, tropical plants and sweet-smelling flowers, white sandy beaches with the most beautiful turquoise ocean waters you have ever seen . . . and the smell of the island, oh &mdash; perfection! Sweet and exquisite!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_20180813_17032110226890536450112265711.jpg" width="600" height="800" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_20180813_17032110226890536450112265711.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_20180813_17032110226890536450112265711-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>And even though right now we live with the shadow of concerns over Amber&rsquo;s future health, what is very clear to us is that all of this is in God&rsquo;s hands, it always has been. Nothing is perfect in this life; not a big trip to Disney World with all the frills and not one&rsquo;s health. And although those things may seem meaningful and seem like everything at the moment, they are only bonuses. The real meaning is how you choose to live this life at every moment with the people you love.</p>
<p>Matt&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s passing was dark on a bright sunny day. Amber&rsquo;s health, although dark in the beginning seems pretty bright; pretty hopeful &mdash; especially with that golden Hawaiian sun shining down upon her. God&rsquo;s sun.</p>

		<p>How life can take us by surprise sometimes . . .&nbsp; But <strong>good</strong> surprises this time.</p>
<p>We found Amber&rsquo;s <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/07/25/day-126-its-a-high-five-kind-of-day/">MRI this past Wednesday</a>&nbsp;surprising in that she had nothing &ldquo;new&rdquo; going on.&nbsp; She has <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/03/27/amber-update-day-6-early-edition/">Glioblastoma Multiforme</a> which is an aggressive type of cancer, surely something should have shown up on this MRI, right?&nbsp; There may still be&nbsp;something sinister going on that the MRI didn&rsquo;t pick up, but even knowing that, I can easily say that I wasn&rsquo;t the only one thrown off by Wednesday&rsquo;s findings (or lack of).&nbsp; Therefore, we offer to God, family (past and present), and friends, a big THANK YOU &ndash;&nbsp; Matt and I are truly humbled by your outpouring of prayers and good positive thoughts for Amber.&nbsp; Along with the tremendous medical care Amber has been receiving, the prayers and thoughts clearly have had an impact, and so we celebrate these results.</p>
<p>Then came Friday, and another awesome surprise.&nbsp; Amber&rsquo;s wish from Make-A-Wish has been granted.&nbsp; Did I say &ldquo;wish&rdquo;? I should have said&nbsp;<em>wishes</em> because not only is Amber going to be swimming with dolphins, she is going to be swimming with dolphins in <strong><em>Hawaii</em></strong>.&nbsp; And yes, I am still picking my jaw up off the floor.</p>
<p>Make-A-Wish is absolutely phenomenal.&nbsp; They wanted a special way to reveal Amber&rsquo;s granted wishes.&nbsp; So, they had <a href="https://thebridgemarketgroton.com/mobile-pizza-parties">The Bridge Market Mobile Pizza Trailer</a> come to our home to make fresh brick oven pizzas for us &ndash; cheese, pepperoni, veggie, and an incredible maple-bacon pizza.&nbsp; Then there was the first dessert &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benjerry.com/mohegansun/catering">Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s </a>came and set up a sundae station inside our house.&nbsp; The sundae station had 4 types of ice cream, with Hot Fudge, Caramel, and Whipped Cream.&nbsp; Then there were the toppings:&nbsp; Mini M&amp;M&rsquo;s, Reeses Pieces, Oreos, Chocolate and Rainbow Sprinkles!&nbsp; And THEN, there was the second dessert.&nbsp; A gorgeous mermaid cake and cupcakes.&nbsp; Make-A-Wish certainly knew how to spoil us!!!&nbsp; How can a simple &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; even suffice? . . .</p>

		<p>Good News &ndash; Amber&rsquo;s MRI scan came back looking good!</p>
<p>It was a pretty long day, with us leaving the house around 8:00 and getting back home about 5:00.&nbsp; We started with an early visit with Dr. Gillan in the Hem/Onc clinic, then went downstairs for the MRI, and returned to Hem/Onc to get the results.</p>
<p>The scan came back looking good &ndash; there are no signs of any regrowth, at all!!&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;good&rdquo; &ndash; this is as good as it could have possibly been.&nbsp; As Dr Martin said to us today: there are times when we need to have detailed, serious conversations, but then there are days like today &ndash; today is a High Five Kind of Day!</p>
<p>We have used several metaphors and analogies over the past 4 months &mdash; <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/03/day-13-the-elephant-and-the-whale/">Eating the Elephant and the Whale</a>, a <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/27/day-37-superhero-day/">Superhero Battle</a>, a <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/05/02/day-42-steps-in-the-journey/">Journey of Many Steps</a> .&nbsp; Well, today we took a megasize bite of the Whale, won a significant battle against a Supervillain, and passed an important milemarker in our Journey.</p>
<p>But we are not done with this.&nbsp; Cancer is not so easy.&nbsp; A clean scan today does not mean she is cured &mdash; it just means that it isn&rsquo;t aggressively attacking at this moment, but could be still hiding somewhere in that brain.&nbsp; We will be returning for MRIs frequently (every 6 weeks, for now) to watch carefully, and with the help of CCMC we will be ready to act when we need to.&nbsp; We still have a lot of Whale left on our plate, several Supervillains in this war, and much distance left of this Journey.</p>
<p>But today &ndash; we celebrate.&nbsp; We thank the doctors and all medical professionals that have helped get us this far.&nbsp; We thank everyone who has been praying, sending us positive thoughts, and supporting us through this.&nbsp; We offer a prayer of thanks to God for granting us such a blessing today.&nbsp; And we continue to pray, and ask others to pray, for Amber&rsquo;s positive results to continue into the future &ndash; until we have devoured the Whale, finished off the final Supervillain in this war, and reached the point of this crazy Journey where all we see is smooth sailing ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you all, God Bless.</p>

		<p>Matt and I want to thank everyone who took the time out of their busy Friday evening schedules to come and support Amber (and us) at the Holy Hour.&nbsp; Thank You!!!!</p>
<p>Amber is finding her <span style="color:#800080;"><em>way</em></span> around all kinds of places this summer!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to share some with you &mdash;</p>
<hr>
<h2><span style="color:#800080;"><em><strong>Let&rsquo;s Ride!</strong></em></span></h2>
<p>Amber&rsquo;s Physical Therapist Elyce got in contact with a man named Frank from an organization called &ldquo;Save The Kid&rdquo; where they donate specially designed bikes to kids with special needs.&nbsp; So, lo and behold, Frank stopped by with a bike for Amber!&nbsp; He also gave us a special hand strap for &ldquo;Lefty&rdquo; so that it stays in place when she&rsquo;s riding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-569" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bikeblog.jpg?w=300" alt="bikeblog" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bikeblog.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bikeblog-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<hr>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#800080;">Salty The Unicorn!</span></strong></h2>
<p>Amber&rsquo;s Occupational Therapist Michelle recommended a place in Windham, CT called Indian Hollow Stables, where there is an actual unicorn!&nbsp; She thought it might be something Amber would be interested in &mdash; which she totally was!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-572" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/saltyblog.jpg?w=300" alt="saltyblog" width="300" height="237" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/saltyblog.jpg 2100w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/saltyblog-300x237.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/saltyblog-1024x809.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/saltyblog-768x607.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/saltyblog-1536x1214.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/saltyblog-2048x1619.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#800080;">Stars &amp; Stripes Kid!</span></strong></h2>
<p>Another super cool thing that happened in June is that Amber had the opportunity to be a Stars And Stripes Kid at the Connecticut Tigers Game!&nbsp; GO TIGERS!!!!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-570" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/starsandstripesblog.jpg?w=126" alt="starsandstripesblog" width="126" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/starsandstripesblog.jpg 288w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/starsandstripesblog-126x300.jpg 126w" sizes="(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px"></p>
<hr>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#800080;">Amber The Mermaid!</span></strong></h2>
<p>Amber loves mermaids&hellip;like a lot.&nbsp; So, why not have her become one?&nbsp; Check this amazing bathing suit out!&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t necessarily swim with the bottom part yet but she will soon enough.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-571" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/forblog.jpg" alt="forblog" width="288" height="393" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/forblog.jpg 288w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/forblog-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px"></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is Sunday and in 3 days is Amber&rsquo;s MRI.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s here already but I definitely want it to just come so we can get it over with and move on &mdash; whatever that means.</p>
<p>Her MRI is now a bit later than first anticipated so I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s going to be around 11 AM instead of 10 AM on Wednesday.&nbsp; Regardless, we meet with Dr. Gillan, Dr. Martin, and Dr. Bertsch at 2:30 PM with the results.</p>
<p>Please pray for Amber.&nbsp; Please pray for a clean and healthy brain.&nbsp; Maybe even go a bit further and pray that she is miraculously cured and healed . . . I know I do.</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp; &lt;3</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">This past week was extra special because we took our family on vacation.&nbsp; The whole family; the six of us, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">together</span>.&nbsp; It was a vacation that has been planned since the beginning of February.&nbsp; A vacation that very well <em>should</em> have been canceled given the tumultuous months following that booking.&nbsp; Fortunately for us though, it was a vacation that was just meant to be &mdash; Amber is with us and is doing well AND it happened to be scheduled just right too, in between radiation and her next MRI.&nbsp; It was the vacation that was just <em>meant to be</em>.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s summer family vacation was to <a href="https://www.ogunquit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ogunquit, ME</a>.&nbsp; A very quaint, small town bustling with all sorts of things to do:&nbsp; beaches, shopping, restaurants, antiquing, hiking a mountain, a theater with Broadway musicals, art galleries, trolleys, etc.&nbsp; This was the first time taking our family there as a whole.&nbsp; Ogunquit has always held a very special place in my heart and it was time to share that with my own family.</p>
<p>We found ourselves at the beach a few times throughout our vacation and I can say for sure that it certainly helps soothe the soul.&nbsp; The warm white sand beneath our toes, the ocean breeze, the ebb and flow of the waves . . . the children&rsquo;s laughter, the scent of sunscreen in the air, the seagulls cawing&nbsp;&mdash; these wonderful things combined with our family getting to experience them together, <strong>that</strong> was soul soothing.&nbsp; And when it was evening and we got to witness the sun going down and casting a beautiful golden hue reflecting off the ocean and the beach, that too was soul soothing.&nbsp; A naturally gorgeous gift from God himself to help remind us just how precious and magnificent life can be.&nbsp; Thank you for that God and thank you for having Amber be apart of this year&rsquo;s summer family vacation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we are looking ahead to the next significant thing, which is Amber&rsquo;s MRI.&nbsp; Her MRI is scheduled for Wednesday, July 25th, around 10AM.&nbsp; This is our next big step in discovering what our plan of action is.&nbsp; So now we pray, and we pray hard.&nbsp; We ask that if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind saying extra prayers for Amber near/on Wednesday, July 25th, that would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Also, if anyone is interested, our friends have set up another Holy Hour for Amber&rsquo;s approaching MRI.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;scheduled for this Friday, July 20th, from 7-8PM at our Church, <a href="http://stmarybaltic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St.&nbsp;</a><a href="http://stmarybaltic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary&rsquo;s Church</a>&nbsp;in Baltic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for everything &mdash; your positive thoughts and prayers have had such a positive impact on her, and on us!</p>

		<p>Never in my life did I think that I would be in a situation where <em><span style="color:#333333;">(A)</span></em> I would have to bring my youngest daughter for radiation treatments because she actually has cancer and <em><span style="color:#333333;">(B)</span></em>&nbsp;I am actually sad that today is Amber&rsquo;s last day of treatment.&nbsp; Crazy, I know.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; Cancer sucks.&nbsp; Radiation sucks.&nbsp; However, the radiation crew at Backus Hospital in Norwich, they made it not suck.&nbsp; In fact, the emotion that I am physically having right now is a feeling of love, happiness, and admiration for the folks in the radiation department.</p>
<p>From the start of this part of Amber&rsquo;s journey (the radiation treatments) this department has welcomed us with open and loving arms, and took us under their wings.&nbsp; All throughout her 30 treatments, they have treated Amber like a family member, not &ldquo;just&rdquo; a patient.&nbsp; But their kindness did not stop at just Amber.&nbsp; They were so thoughtful and sweet towards Ryan, Brianna, Marie, and Matt and me.&nbsp; They certainly went above and beyond.&nbsp; And for me, personally, since I was the one that mainly brought Amber to her appointments every day since May 17th, the radiation crew made me feel &ldquo;human&rdquo; again.&nbsp; With the way these past 3 months have been, it was nice to have people (<em>who didn&rsquo;t even know me</em>) take interest in me and my well being, making sure that <em><strong><span style="color:#333333;">I</span></strong></em> was doing okay.&nbsp; But not just checking in on my sanity &mdash; actually taking the time to talk with me and ask how my weekend was or how my day was going or making me laugh.&nbsp; I honestly did not know going into this that I would be this torn inside with my feelings and emotions on Amber&rsquo;s final day today.&nbsp; The kindness and love from a group of individuals that did not even know us at first, but wanted to get to know us, day after day &mdash; it blossomed into an awesome friendship.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-full wp-image-547 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radiation-crew-e1530224470849.jpg" alt="radiation-crew.jpg" width="432" height="324" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radiation-crew-e1530224470849.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/radiation-crew-e1530224470849-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"></p>
<p>And even more, the other patients at radiation &mdash; what a beautiful group of people.&nbsp; Sharing in something so sad and somber with Amber but also perhaps (hopefully) having their spirits lifted when they saw her; her positive progression, her smile, and her laugh each week.&nbsp; I hope seeing Amber in these ways gives a sense of <span style="color:#333333;">Hope</span> for those that especially need it right now.</p>
<p>So in short (too late) &mdash; Radiation itself sucks but the people that we&rsquo;ve come to know at radiation, they totally rock!&nbsp; A truly <span style="color:#333333;">Bittersweet</span> moment for sure.</p>
<p>So God did it again.&nbsp; HE made something that has been so life-changing and at some points devastating, and He turned it into something wonderful.&nbsp; He put us in another situation that we were <span style="color:#333333;"><em>meant</em></span> to be in . . . brought strangers together to become lifetime friends.</p>
<p>Why God has put us together specifically with these lovely wonderful people from our time during radiation . . . well, I haven&rsquo;t figured it out, <em>yet</em>.&nbsp; But it is certain that HIS plan for Amber (and us) continues on.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s way is Amber&rsquo;s way and we just have to be patient to see where it leads us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; On a side note, un-radiation related, as I was triple checking this post and adding/changing its content, Amber&rsquo;s loose tooth came out &mdash; not by her pulling it by fingers mind you, but by way of her tongue pushing it out!&nbsp; This is Amber&rsquo;s 1st tooth!!!!!</p>

		<p>This past week has proven to be yet another new &ldquo;New Normal&rdquo; for the Smith household.&nbsp; The girls were officially done for summer two Fridays ago, and normally the schedule we once had diminishes and we have to readjust to a new summer schedule.&nbsp; So the same is obviously true for this year too, however, add in Amber&rsquo;s many appointments and her &ldquo;at home duties&rdquo; to the mix and it&rsquo;s just plain chaos.&nbsp; Thank God, literally, for grandparents because without the help of them, I would be in the loony bin.&nbsp; Suffice to say, we made it through the week not too bruised or battered!&nbsp; <em>(it&rsquo;s funny how life has a way of doing that&hellip;)</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" size-medium wp-image-542 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435.jpg?w=190" alt="Am2" width="190" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435.jpg 713w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435-190x300.jpg 190w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/am2-e1529879939435-648x1024.jpg 648w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px">In between all the chaos of this past week, I have to say that Super Amber Grace, is&nbsp;walking . . . by herself mind you, all over the place, and quite well.&nbsp; And, when she&rsquo;s been sitting and is bored with it, she gets up out of her sitting place and walks around, just because.&nbsp; Walks to any place she can.&nbsp; And when we ask her where she&rsquo;s walking to she just says &ldquo;just around, I gotta get my PT in&rdquo;!&nbsp; Well alrighty then &mdash; how can we argue with that?&nbsp; I mean seriously!!!</p>
<p>At the beginning of last week, Amber and I met with an APRN named Victoria from Dr. Gillan&rsquo;s Oncology group and then Dr. Martin from Neurosurgery for some routine follow ups.&nbsp; Everything was good.&nbsp; One thing that was discussed at both appointments (and then later was confirmed) was Amber&rsquo;s next MRI, or as I like to call it (and I believe it was Dr. Martin <em>way</em> <em>back</em> in the beginning who called it), &ldquo;<strong>The Truth Machine</strong>&ldquo;,&nbsp; which is scheduled for Wednesday, July 25th, 2018.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when we learn the truth of what&rsquo;s happening inside Amber&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>And . . . I am scared out of my mind, but in a numb kind of way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the kind of physical feeling of combining the emotional feeling of actually being scared but mixed with my mind consciously saying &ldquo;it is what it is&rdquo;.&nbsp; Kind of like that giving up feeling.&nbsp; Because in truth, <em>it is what it is</em>.&nbsp; Amber&rsquo;s outcome is either:&nbsp; status quo, no regrowth or:&nbsp; bad, there are more tumors lurking.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;ve been praying like crazy and saying the Rosary every night asking for the impossible &mdash; for Amber to be completely healed and cured of cancer . . . but, what if it <em><span style="color:#333333;">was</span></em> possible?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what <span style="color:#333333;">Hope</span> is, right?</p>
<p>Please, if you can, say an extra prayer for Amber &mdash; especially as we near July 25th.&nbsp; As I&rsquo;ve said in the past, I truly and wholeheartedly believe in the power of prayer &mdash; it&rsquo;s been made apparent to me, especially over these past 3 months.&nbsp; And also, please don&rsquo;t get annoyed with me as we get closer to her MRI date when I keep asking, and asking, and asking,&nbsp; for you to say an extra prayer for Amber.&nbsp; My father used to tell me I was really good at nagging him when I was a kid.&nbsp; My husband loves to tell me that I am the best at nagging him to death to get things done around the house and geez, don&rsquo;t even get me started on what my kids thing of my nagging!&nbsp; What can I say &mdash; it&rsquo;s a gift and a curse!</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp; &#128578;</p>
