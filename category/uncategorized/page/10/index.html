		<p>Amber did a whole lotta nothing today, and that&rsquo;s okay. The way this girl has been working hard this past week, a day of rest was very much earned and well deserved.</p>
<p>A little bit of talking, a little bit of writing, a little visiting, a little TV watching, and a little bit of coloring was about the extent of the day.</p>
<p>A day of relaxing is very much needed to prepare for the week ahead, starting with the biggest upcoming event, insertion of G-tube &amp; removal of staples and stitches in the head tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind, extra prayers for Amber&rsquo;s surgery tomorrow would be very much appreciated!! Thank you everyone!! &#128156;</p>

		<p>We started the day with a trip to the imaging department, for a fluoroscopy to confirm all of her internals are flowing correctly, to prepare for the g-tube surgery on Monday. Was pretty cool watching in real-time as the contrast worked it&rsquo;s way through her system, with the scanning machine snapping dozens of pictures. Everything looks good, so we are full steam ahead for Monday.</p>
<p>We returned to the room, and started to watch TV, when I decided to try something else &ndash; because too much TV isn&rsquo;t good for anyone. I handed Amber a crayon, and held a coloring book in her lap. And she immediately started coloring! Not just scribbles across the page either &ndash; she stayed inside the lines, indicating (to me, anyway) both good vision and good control. She didn&rsquo;t get very far on her picture before tiring out, but this work of art is going right on the fridge!!</p>
<p>But then, as I&rsquo;m putting things away, I think I hear Amber breathing roughly, like she did when the breathing tube was removed. I look over, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be struggling at all &ndash; when I realize that she is moving her lips and making sounds! I can&rsquo;t quite make out what she is saying, but she is definitely trying to talk. So I encourage her and tell her I love her, and I ask if she can say &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; &ndash; AND SHE DOES! Very softly, but more than just a whisper, and very clear. It is pretty hard for her, but she is excited, we are excited, and she does it several more times during the day. This is another major milestone for her!</p>
<p>Then, we cap it all off by taking her for a stroll outside. It&rsquo;s a beautiful sunny day, about 70&deg;F, and Amber&rsquo;s Physical Therapist got everything lined up so we could take her out in her wheelie chair for about 40 minutes. To make things even sweeter, her Speech Therapist lined up the permission for us to feed her a popsicle, so we are outside in the sun, eating the best tasting orange popsicle ever, with her brother and sisters, aunt and uncle visiting too. This was a wonderful picture to see.</p>
<p>Lots of beautiful pictures today, surpassed only by the beauty of a few words, delivered by our beautiful Amber. We thank God for letting us experience this beauty today.</p>

		<p>Another busy, exhausting day for Amber &ndash; but again, forward progress.</p>
<p>Physical Therapy had her on the floor with me today, and tried a few positions.  She did well propping herself up on her elbows (yes, both of them!), but was pretty worn out from <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/12/day-22-evening-addition/">yesterday&rsquo;s PT</a> so she didn&rsquo;t last very long.  She woke up a bit, though, with Speech Therapy.  While she didn&rsquo;t want the chocolate ice cream they tried first, she definitely liked the orange popsicle.  After a bit of a nap, we got back on the floor with Occupational Therapy, and I got to <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/12/day-22-snuggle-time/">snuggle</a> with her a bit.  Then it was nap time again.</p>
<p>A quiet evening, but then it was decided that Amber should have GI scan tomorrow morning to prep for the g-tube surgery on Monday.  So, we are switching off her food at midnight tonight, and supplying only liquids, by IV &ndash; but of course, her one remaining IV decided it&rsquo;s been in too long (3 weeks) and needed to be replaced.  Amber&rsquo;s veins decided not to cooperate too well (they&rsquo;ve been through a lot lately), so it took 3 tries with lots of tears &ndash; but it&rsquo;s done, and I sit here now watching her sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>I prayed the Rosary earlier tonight, reflecting on the Sorrowful Mysteries.  I may not be able to understand exactly what Amber is going through herself, the fear, the pain, her trial.  But as a parent, as Amber&rsquo;s Dad, I find my own pain, my agony, in not being able to take this for her, in not being able to just fix this for her, in not being able understand why this must happen.</p>
<p>And so I have spent much time praying to Mary, asking for her intercession as a sympathetic parent.  At this point, we know what Amber must go through (there is no looking back), so we just pray for the strength for her to continue forward, and the strength for us to carry her, to take as much of this burden as we are allowed.  And as we have throughout our journey so far, we pray for those that are providing medical care to Amber, that they have the strength and clarity to continue to provide the best possible care they can.</p>

		<p>Amber thoroughly made my day today . . .</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m home with the kiddos today. This afternoon Ryan suggested a video chat with Amber and Daddy. I give them a call and Matt informs me that Amber had just fallen asleep (whoops!). As we&rsquo;re talking, Amber wakes up, so Matt brings the phone over to her. As usual, I&rsquo;m kissing into the phone and blowing her kisses.  Matt says &ldquo;Amber, can you blow Mama some kisses back?&rdquo;. As I watch what happens next, I&rsquo;m stunned. Amber is not only making the kiss noise (more movement than actual noise) but her beautiful little right hand comes up towards her mouth at the same time! Not quite all the way because her hand is restrained (she wants to scratch her healing head all the time). So, Matt frees her hand and asks her to do it again &mdash; AND SHE DOES &mdash; she brings that little hand all the way up to her mouth and blows me kisses!!! WHAT?? I am still shocked so I ask &ldquo;Has she been doing this all day with you?&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;This is completely new, right now, what she&rsquo;s doing with you!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am STILL in disbelief right now even as I write this. Thank you Ryan for suggesting the video call. Thank you Amber for doing something new and amazing today. And Thank you God, for making this little miracle happen.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a busy day. Amber continues to do well. PT with Lauren consisted of gym mat on the floor doing exercises. During Amber&rsquo;s &ldquo;rest time&rdquo;, Lauren let me do <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/12/day-22-snuggle-time/">snuggle time</a> with Amber. Let me tell you, that meant THE world to me. The last time I got to &ldquo;snuggle&rdquo; Amber was in between her throwing up every hour 3 weeks ago. So snuggle time today meant more than you know. After exercises on the mat, Lauren was able to get Amber to do a tall kneeling (like when we pray) against the hospital bed. Amber was supported by Lauren but held herself up by herself too, Lauren seemed pretty amazed, as did I! After that was wheelchair time, where we took Amber for a tour of Floor 8.</p>
<p>Speech Therapy was next. While Amber was still in her chair, resting, Sara came in with a cup of chocolate ice cream. It did not seem promising at first as Amber was tightly pursing her lips together. After a bit of persuading, Amber took a small bite! After another small bite, and a few sips of water, Amber graduated to two big bites!</p>
<p>And lastly, OT time. Caitlin made good use of the floor mat as well. She had Amber sitting up against her and had me hold a stack of Legos. Amber took a block off the top! She did it again! Next I loosened a top Lego and Amber pushed it down twice. After that, Caitlin got Amber down on her side for a bit where it looked like she was about to conk off! Then, tummy time where Caitlin was helping Amber with her neck. Amber was starting to get uncomfortable, so it was back to her side and then back to sitting against Caitlin. Then Caitlin asked if we&rsquo;d like to do snuggle time &mdash; Um, you don&rsquo;t have to ask me twice!!</p>
<p>With Amber in my arms against me, Caitlin sets me up with my back against a pillow, and pillow against Amber&rsquo;s hospital bed, so I could be more comfortable. With my baby girl laying against me again, I can&rsquo;t help but feel like it&rsquo;s been an eternity since she&rsquo;s been in my arms like this. But we&rsquo;re here in the now and I will cherish this day forever.</p>

		<p>It is currently 2:35 PM. I am in a position (litterally) that I thought would never happen again, or best case scenario, wouldn&rsquo;t happen until far out in the future.</p>
<p>I am sitting on the floor of Amber&rsquo;s hospital room, on a gym mat covered in a bedsheet. My back is up against a pillow, up against her hospital bed. Amber is nestled on my belly and chest. My arm securely wrapped around her right shoulder and neck with my hand resting on her belly. She is fast asleep. . . in my arm, against me, snuggling.  The feeling of her against me, warm and comfy, breathing peacefully &mdash; that is something I will never take for granted again.</p>

		<p>Yes, Amber had ice cream for breakfast . . . Vanilla, to be exact! After a couple of bites she was done, and that&rsquo;s okay &mdash; we&rsquo;ll take it!</p>
<p>Later on for PT, Lauren had Amber standing in this very interesting contraption. Amber did well but her helmet was bothering her and soon, she was clearly done. I bet it felt so good to be out of bed and standing, as it has been 21 days since the last time she did.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Caitlin with OT came in with a nifty chair so that we could finally give Amber a proper shower. (We had to switch rooms again yesterday, to a room that has an accessible shower, not a tub).</p>
<p>After all this hard work she earned a well deserved nap!</p>
<p>Although it seems like small steps for us, it is huge steps for Amber. God is good by helping Amber to remain brave and strong-willed &mdash; but then again, we wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything less from Super Amber Grace!</p>

		<p>Amber has been doing <i>really</i> well on the Recovery floor.</p>
<p>Amber is definitely being more active. Lots of smiles, even a few eye-rolls for Daddy.</p>
<p>We had a great session with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy all together. They helped her sit up, and she started supporting her head herself. Then, they offered her a <i><font color="blue">blue</font></i> popsicle &ndash; and she opened her mouth WIDE and stuck out her tongue! A few licks later, she took a bite and swallowed! We even got her to stick out her tongue to show off how <font color="blue"><i>blue</i></font> it was. That is the first food Amber has had in three weeks, and she clearly enjoyed it &ndash; so much, that shortly after we heard her trying to make sounds! PT/OT/ST were very happy with this (as were Mommy and Daddy), so tomorrow PT/OT are going to try giving her a shower and having her support herself (with assistance) on her arms.</p>
<p>Caron went home tonight to spend time with the rest of the family (we&rsquo;ve been alternating nights at home), so we did a little video chat to say good night &ndash; and at the end, when I said &ldquo;ok Amber, can you say good night to Mommy?&rdquo;, I definitely heard some (weak) sounds from her mouth!</p>
<p>We continue to make good progress. Next week we&rsquo;ll be looking to add a g-tube to make sure she is getting sufficient nutrition, and we&rsquo;ve got 3 weeks to build her back up to be ready for the next major steps: MRI, surgery (replacing the skull flap) and then to begin the cancer treatments shortly after.</p>
<p>And so, we pray for strength and healing for Amber over these next few weeks, and the mental and emotional fortitude for all of us to start preparing for that next phase.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to start with a thank you (again). We&rsquo;ve shared some deep, truthful, raw feelings we&rsquo;ve had through this process. While we have had other significant trials in our lives, this is by far the most difficult for us. But the comments, emails, texts, phone calls &hellip; all of this support for us as we support Amber &hellip; has been incredible. Today has been truly moving for us.</p>
<p>Several have commented on the strength of our Faith reflected in our posts here, which made us pause for a moment &ndash; we&rsquo;ve never considered our Faith particularly strong. Sure, we were both raised Roman Catholic, bring our family to Church weekly, and do Believe. But, we&rsquo;ve never been tested like this before, to understand ourselves how strong our Faith really is. This too has been a moving realization for us.</p>
<p>This morning, PT/OT came together and got Amber out of bed and into her chair. They did a whole bunch of exercises with her, which seemed to wake her up and energize her a bit. Still difficult watching her go through these basic muscle exercises, but was quite reassuring to take her down the hall in her chair, and see her enjoy the change in scenery and activity. She even got to pet a dog in the hospital for a bit. And then, Valentine the clown came to visit, and shortly behind was Father Charlie! Amber had a good time with her visitors, lots of smiles. Was very good to get her moving today.</p>
<p>But the biggest news &ndash; today, Amber was moved out of the ICU! With all the tubes out (except the feeding tube) and being stable, it was time to &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; to Recovery on the eighth floor. So we moved all of the cards, flowers, toys, clothes, and food up to the new room. Again, CCMC is a fantastic place &ndash; her new room is bright and cheery, private with a nice couch/bed for us to sleep on, and a private bathroom. It reminded me a little of Moving Day on the first and last days of college.</p>
<p>And lastly, we have a target we are moving towards. April 30 is the tentative date for Amber&rsquo;s next MRI and surgery, to remove any tumor regrowth and replace the skull flap, and May 15 is tentatively when we begin the first round of cancer treatments, as radiation therapy.</p>
<p>So lots of moving today; and a prayer that we just keep moving forward.</p>

		<p>Sunday is a day of rest; and so today we kept things pretty quiet and rested.</p>
<p>We started with a pretty solid 7 hours of sleep (for her, not for me)! It&rsquo;s pretty tough having been asleep for two weeks, and then waking up in a place where there is lights and noise at all times. But Amber finally fell off to sleep about midnight, and slept through till 7 AM with only one interruption about 4 AM to reposition her.</p>
<p>After a morning visitor and sponge bath, Amber took a short nap. Then early this afternoon, we turned off the last of her primary sedative (Fentanyl), reducing her to a much lower dose of an alternative, which is delivered as part of her feeding. This means that all IV medications are done, and they removed her &ldquo;central line&rdquo;. No more IV, everything just delivered via feeding tube! It is beautiful to see all that hardware removed &ndash; all that&rsquo;s left is the feeding tube and a spare IV line in the ankle &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then Amber got to sit upright in her chair for about an hour and a half. We looked out the window for a bit, watched some Minecraft videos on the tablet, and read a Princess Jasmine (Disney&rsquo;s Aladdin) story. And after all this activity, she is taking another short nap.</p>
<p>I had a good conversation with Dr. Paul, one of the neurosurgeons. From that first day she woke where she was giving us thumbs-up and finger snaps, we&rsquo;ve noticed her slow down significantly, so I asked about that. He assures me that this is not unexpected &ndash; her head pressures are good (evidenced by the positive visible depression in her head where the skull flap is removed, which would be swollen and puffy otherwise) so there is no indication of problem. So he believes the lack of activity recently is just a result of her dealing with the exhaustion of breathing on her own and moving around more.</p>
<p>Of course, I trust Dr. Paul, he knows better than I do, and he has been straight with us throughout. I trust God too, that He will continue to do what is best for Amber, and that He will enable the medical staff here to provide the best possible care for her. But as Amber&rsquo;s Dad &hellip; it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to watch my little girl go through this, unable to really communicate, unable to fully comprehend, unable to move much of her body or even swallow properly, unable to focus her vision.</p>
<p>And so I pray that God gives us the strength to do whatever we need to do for Amber, and to accept His will, whatever that may be.</p>
