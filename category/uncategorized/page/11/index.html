		<p>For almost three weeks now, we have been posting updates on Amber&rsquo;s progress to this blog. It&rsquo;s been a bumpy road for Amber, but the progress has been positive. But it&rsquo;s also been a bumpy road for us, her parents. Emotional highs and lows, and deep tests of our Faith. I wrote something privately a few days ago describing (in raw emotional detail) one of those low moments, and decided to share to help others understand a little bit better.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday (Thursday April 5th) was a rough day for me emotionally. I was not at the hospital when her breathing and feed tubes were extubated, and I felt guilty about that. I had slept home the night before with the rest of the family and had some appointments during the day. I know Matt was there and he was good about keeping me well updated and even sent me a picture of her sans facial tubes, which helped but wasn&rsquo;t the same.</p>
<p>Once everything was set at home, it was time to hit the road. As I&rsquo;m driving through Hartford, I can&rsquo;t help but feel anxious about seeing Amber.</p>
<p>Walking from the parking garage, my arms are full of gifts, a bag of food, a second bag of food, a big bag of clean laundry, and my purse. As I smoosh to the back of a cramped elevator, we arrive at Level 3, Amber&rsquo;s floor. After practically knocking people down trying to get out, I can&rsquo;t get to our sleep room fast enough to drop off all this stuff so I can get to my girl.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m walking down the hall, and just as I&rsquo;m about to enter her room, a man with a white plastic helmet excuses himself as he comes out of her room. &ldquo;I was just in there fitting her with this helmet and we should have one for her soon&rdquo;. I politely nod and say okay. Then walk into Amber&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>She looks good with no tubes on her face . . . but that&rsquo;s not entirely what my mind and tightness of my belly was focusing on. As I look at her, lying straight in bed, I see the left side of her head kind of awkwardly in the pillow, and the right side shaved with several lines of staples. She&rsquo;s awake but with her eyes mainly to the right, bubbles pooled in her mouth, and raspy breathing. When she yawns, it&rsquo;s only the right side . . . and on further inspection, I see that the left side of her face and mouth clearly has a droop. It saddens me. Because even though I &ldquo;knew&rdquo; it was going to be a long road, seeing her like this validates just how really long the road will be.</p>
<p>Not knowing if Amber can get back to what Amber was, hurts my heart so much. It is so scary and I hate that there is doubt in my heart. I&rsquo;m supposed to be strong for her but I was standing there with all these thoughts and emotions coursing through me, and in my mind&rsquo;s eye, I saw myself high-tailing it out of this room, out of this hospital, and out of CT. What hurt my heart the most? Is the fact that I am a coward.</p>
<p>Self doubt. Doubt in everything. Just feeling low..</p>
<p>But then, when she saw me in her view, and gave me a little right sided smile with an ever so slight dimple showing&hellip;all of those feelings that were so strong just seconds ago, fizzled out just a tiny bit. Even though I know there is a good chance Amber will never be as she once was, I&rsquo;m glad that God is giving me a little bit more extra time with her today.</p></blockquote>

		<p>After a sponge bath in the morning, the doctors felt that she needed to have the feeding tube put back in. As I&rsquo;m standing there watching our nurses, Rose and Angie, struggle to get it placed correctly, Amber is clearly in discomfort, even with medication. I felt so bad and had to stop myself from crying several times. After what felt like an eternity, they were done.</p>
<p>We got to celebrate Matt&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s 70th Birthday with Amber today. After hanging out with her, Uncle Mark and Auntie Meg came up to look after her for a few hours so we could go out for lunch to celebrate than go to Mass at Father Charlie&rsquo;s Church. After Mass, Father Charlie gave Matt and I big hugs and asked about Amber. He also let the kids pick out Koosh balls.</p>
<p>Back at the hospital, we find that the doctors have removed her a-line and one of her IV&rsquo;s. Marie gives Amber a pink Koosh ball that she picked out for her as well as Ryan giving her the purple one he picked out. Amber loved it! Marie secured it to her finger and she was moving her arm and hand all around with it, touching it, squishing it, pincer grasping it&hellip;what a great toy (and therapy) For her!</p>

		<p>Amber received her first sponge bath today along with a very much needed shampooing.</p>
<p>After the bustle of her bath the &ldquo;T&rdquo; team came in in a swarm: Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy. They decided it was time for her to sit in a chair. So they lifted her gently making sure all of her tubing was out of the way yet still connected and put her in it. She looked like such a big girl and she looked a little relieved maybe to be out of that bed . . . who wouldn&rsquo;t be after 16 days of being laid up? She ended up staying like that for 2 hours! She was definitely tired by the end of the session. While she was in her chair, the Speech Therapist tried giving her some sips of water. She did swallow a little bit but did end up coughing which the therapists think scared her because she made sure to keep her lips tight when the therapist tried apple sauce. Right now she is getting an IV with nutrients but Dr. Martin has warned us that she may require a feed tube through her belly to get the feeding that she really needs.</p>
<p>She has not done much communication today with us I think she is exhausted and frustrated from the past couple of days . . . that or maybe as she&rsquo;s coming down from the sedation and reality is starting to sink in?</p>
<p>So, still moving forward, one step at a time, and many many steps still to go . . .</p>

		<p>The rest of the day was fairly quiet. Still coming down on the sedations; so she stays more awake and alert. We met with speech therapy in the afternoon. Amber was able to drink a little bit of water, and tasted just a little bit of applesauce &ndash; enough to show that she can swallow just fine. Tomorrow we will try some more, hopefully her throat is a bit less sore so she is more willing. No talking yet, but Mom caught a few vocal sounds coming out when she yawned.</p>
<p>But, the highlight for me today &ndash; Amber smiled! With all the tubes removed, Amber gave me that &ldquo;oh Daddy, knock it off&rdquo; trademark smirk. While physically it may still be a weak smile, it was the strongest smile I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Tonight, I came home to spend the night with the rest of our family. Marie, Brianna, and Ryan have been so brave, so incredibly strong through this all. Sometimes I wonder if they understand the magnitude of all this; then out of the blue they&rsquo;ll say or ask something that proves that they do understand completely ( Ryan at a 3-year old level, of course ). Truly, we are blessed to have such a strong, tight family, and to be supported by our larger family and friends through this all.</p>
<p>So again, today we pray for strength for Amber to continue taking these great steps in the right direction, and for the medical staff who are providing such great care and support to Amber and to us. And we thank God for our children, our family, our friends; the time we have already had, and the time still ahead of us.</p>

		<p>Early update, as I didn&rsquo;t want to wait until tonight.</p>
<p>Already today we have taken another big step &ndash; the breathing tube and food tube were both just removed! She is resting peacefully, much mouth and throat discomfort, but her breathing is strong. Speech therapy will be checking in a bit later to see how she is swallowing and if she is ready for talking!</p>
<p>Also had a CT Scan this morning, which looks good.</p>
<p>Not just another bite off the elephant &ndash; I think we ate a whole elephant steak today. And it&rsquo;s not even noon yet!</p>

		<p>Super Heroes have super powers right?</p>
<p>We have been watching (and blogging about) how Amber is doing as she travels this road to recovery, and taking special note of those things we find most interesting. Her communicating with us through our &ldquo;own&rdquo; sign language, things like: right hand squeezes, number of fingers up (#2 means well, #2 and #1 means privacy please), thumbs up, finger snapping, nodding and maybe, even a smirk. As well as trying to breathe on her own and moving her legs and right arm wonderfully. Having no experience with this ourselves, we figure that these are just the normal steps down this road. But to have multiple doctors come to her room today to see her because of this &ldquo;profound recovery&rdquo; (their words) and learning that this progress is well beyond their expectations, two even leaving with happy tears in their eyes &mdash; that is flooring. Yes, still a <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/03/day-13-the-elephant-and-the-whale/">long long way</a> to go, but definitely heartening to understand that Amber is off to a super start.</p>
<p><u>In that same vein:</u></p>
<p>I never thought in a million years that my daughter would be celebrating her 1/2 birthday not only in the hospital recovering from 2 brain surgeries, but also battling a terminal illness.</p>
<p>6 months ago, when she turned 6 years old, she received a D.C. Super Hero Girl doll &mdash; a Super Girl. A doll that hauntingly looks just like Amber; blonde hair, blue eyes. Not just any blue eyes mind you, but blue eyes with a twinkle of spunk in them&hellip;just like Amber. This doll is a special doll. Special yes, because it&rsquo;s one of her favorite characters on the show but more like, it&rsquo;s a doll that imitates her life currently. Amber <i>is</i> Super Girl. She is my true life super hero. For what she&rsquo;s endured over these past 14 days&hellip;no one, (let alone a 6.5 year old girl) should ever have to go through something devastating like this. But reality is, she is. And reality is, she&rsquo;s fighting this Amber&rsquo;s Way. A Super Girl fighting her own form of kryptonite, and fighting it hard. For that, Amber is not only just Amber Grace, she&rsquo;s Super Amber Grace&hellip;and she&rsquo;s my hero.</p>

		<p>How do you eat an elephant?&nbsp; One bite at a time.&nbsp; Another good day today, but also reminders of what is still ahead of us.</p>
<p>Right from day #1, Dr. Martin cautioned us that we were going to be eating an elephant.&nbsp; Thinking about this process as a singular whole is terrifying, so we&rsquo;ve been forcing ourselves to tackle this one day at a time, one bite at a time, one milestone at a time.</p>
<p>Today, Amber continued to improve her communication with us.&nbsp; She will wave when she wants us, will squeeze our hand or give us thumbs-up to yes and no questions, and can show us however many fingers (on her right hand) as we ask.&nbsp; But, as Caron noted <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/02/day-12-a-thumbs-up/">yesterday</a>, I can be a bit &ldquo;persistent&rdquo;.&nbsp; I know there is a risk to her memory from the original stroke and second surgery, so today I decided to see if we could test that.&nbsp; I asked her if she remembered the Daddy/Daughter dance from a few weeks back, and she squeezed my hand &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then I asked if she remembered the dress she wore, and again, she squeezed &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then I told her I was going to ask her about the color of her dress.&nbsp; Did you wear a red dress? No squeeze.&nbsp; Did you wear a yellow dress?&nbsp; No squeeze.&nbsp; Did you wear a green dress?&nbsp; Definitely got a good (correct!) squeeze from her!&nbsp; &nbsp;So let&rsquo;s try this again &mdash; I ask if she remembers that we were going to go on vacation, and used the same process to ask if we were going to California, Texas, or Cape Cod.&nbsp; And again, she correctly answers &ldquo;Cape Cod&rdquo;.&nbsp; All definitely good steps.&nbsp; And so throughout the day, we&rsquo;ve built up a small collection of hand movements &mdash; waving her hand means she wants us; a thumbs up or snap of the fingers (yep, she can do that too!) means &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want that&rdquo;; two fingers means she needs to make a &ldquo;number two&rdquo;; one finger means she wants me to go away and give her privacy while she tries to make a &ldquo;number two&rdquo;.&nbsp; She is, of course, frustrated that she can&rsquo;t express everything she wants, but at least we have a start.</p>
<p>And I received lots of one-fingers and finger-snaps today; so while she can&rsquo;t talk yet, her sass is definitely still there.</p>
<p>And some more good news &ndash; the sedative has been further reduced, and the final cranial line (an &ldquo;EVD&rdquo;) was removed.&nbsp; The next bite in eating this elephant is to reduce and eliminate the breathing machine and the breathing tube from her throat, and seeing how she does verbally.&nbsp; This should begin over the next several days.&nbsp; In parallel, we&rsquo;ve also started working with PT and OT on some basics to work on muscle strength and dexterity.</p>
<p>We also discussed a bit more about the remaining elephant.&nbsp; Based on the impact to the brain up to this point, we expect that Amber&rsquo;s left arm and left leg will suffer some long-term (possibly permanent) impairment &ndash; both weakness and poor fine motor skills.&nbsp; We also expect her to have poor, and possibly zero, left side vision (note &ndash; not left eye damage, but rather the left peripheral vision of each eye).&nbsp; Of course, we will work hard with PT, OT, and whatever else we can to continue to improve over time.</p>
<p>And then, there is still a whale to be eaten too.&nbsp; Once we stabilize her physical state (the elephant), we can begin treating the glioblastoma (the whale).&nbsp; We got the report from Dr. Martin today that he met with the Tumor Review Board here at CCMC, and they have begun putting together the plan.&nbsp; In a few weeks (three-ish), she will receive another MRI to confirm there has been no tumor regrowth.&nbsp; Then, the &ldquo;skull flap&rdquo; (the piece removed during the original surgery) will be replaced.&nbsp; After this, we can begin the first phase of cancer treatment &ndash; radiation therapy.</p>
<p>So, how do you eat an elephant&nbsp;<em>and</em> a whale?&nbsp; Still, just one bite at a time.</p>
<p>A closing thought &ndash; my dad said something profound to me yesterday.&nbsp; He has been praying for Amber, for her strength, for her recovery.&nbsp; But yesterday morning he mentioned that he paused to add a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; &mdash; Thank You God for the time we spent with Amber on Sunday, and more generally for her being a blessing in our life.&nbsp; And so I would like to do the same here.&nbsp; God, Thank You for blessing us with Amber, for giving us the time with this beautiful little girl, no matter how long or short it may be.&nbsp; Thank You for the family you&rsquo;ve given us, all of our beautiful children, and the time you&rsquo;ve given us with them.&nbsp; Thank You for the incredible family and friends that are supporting us through this process, and Thank You for the people at the Connecticut Children&rsquo;s Medical Center who have been working so hard and been so kind to Amber and to us.&nbsp; And Thank You for giving us hope that we can indeed eat this elephant, and this whale, one bite at a time.&nbsp; And maybe still have room for an ice cream sundae at the end.</p>

		<p>Today was a Thumbs Up kind of day.&nbsp; Literally.</p>
<p>An uneventful morning with watching her numbers and making sure she was comfortable.&nbsp; With the lowered sodium intake her head pressure number has been staying in range.&nbsp; The doctors gave our nurse Alex the okay to lower her sedative even more.&nbsp; Her blood pressure has finally lowered a bit but her her heart rate has been sporadic most of the time and elevated when she is stressed out.&nbsp; When she is stressed out she shakes with muscle tremors and clearly looks scared, which breaks our heart.&nbsp; With a firm holding of her hand and whispers of comfort, she finally settles down.</p>
<p>She had her first visit from her Physical Therapist Lauren.&nbsp; One thing that Lauren did, was ask Amber to move her ankle&hellip;and Amber moved her right ankle!</p>
<p>Later in the day, Amber had her eyes open and Alex was checking her over.&nbsp; Alex held her hand and asked Amber to squeeze it&hellip; and she did!&nbsp; Alex went one step further with it, &ldquo;Amber, can you wiggle your toes?&rdquo;&hellip; Amber wiggled her right toes!&nbsp; <em>Amazing</em>.&nbsp; So then Matt asked, &ldquo;Amber, would you like us to put the TV on?&nbsp; Squeeze Mama&rsquo;s hand if you would like us to put it on&rdquo;.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; So Matt asks a different question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Okay, how about some music, would you like us to play some music?&nbsp; Squeeze Mama&rsquo;s hand if you want us to put some music on&rdquo;&hellip;&nbsp; Big squeeze!&nbsp; <em>Yes!</em>&nbsp; So then I ask Amber &ldquo;Oh Amber, how about some Minecraft with Pat and Jen (her favorite set of YouTube videos)?&nbsp; Would you like that?&rdquo;&hellip;she nods her head, ever so slightly!&nbsp; Matt says &ldquo;Amber, squeeze Mama&rsquo;s hand if you want some Minecraft.&rdquo;&hellip;she squeezes my hand!&nbsp; So, Matt takes it a step further &mdash; &ldquo;Amber, if you can hear it, put one finger up&rdquo;&hellip;Amber slowly puts one finger out!&nbsp; <em>Wow &mdash; okay &mdash; so at this point I&rsquo;m trying not to freak out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Matt takes it up a notch &mdash; &ldquo;Okay Amber, good job with putting your finger up.&nbsp; If you can see the Minecraft video, put 3 fingers up.&rdquo;&hellip;Amber uncurled 3 little fingers!!!&nbsp; <em>I&rsquo;m floored &mdash; I&rsquo;m trying every ounce of to contain myself, I cannot believe she is communicating with us &mdash; WOW!!!</em>&nbsp; So then Matt pushes it even further (yes, Matt is definitely persistent) &mdash; &ldquo;Okay Amber, you are doing such a GREAT job, but one more thing, can you give us a thumbs up?&rdquo;&hellip;and there goes the thumb.&nbsp; Slowly, weakly, but it was definite.&nbsp; Our baby girl, after 12 days of not communicating, has given us a Thumbs Up!</p>
<p>A Thumbs Up day for sure.&nbsp; A celebration.&nbsp; But making sure to keep everything in perspective.&nbsp; There will be ups and there will be downs, today was an up, but we don&rsquo;t know yet what tomorrow may hold.&nbsp; I am simply hopeful for more ups than downs.&nbsp; To bring it back to Dr. Martin for a moment&hellip;he made a reference to Amber&rsquo;s situation the day she came here by comparing it to eating an elephant.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t eat a whole elephant in one bite.&nbsp; The way you eat an elephant is to take small bites&hellip;lots and lots of bites, and eventually, that elephant will be almost all gone, but remember, it&rsquo;s a BIG elephant.&nbsp; We have a massive amount of elephant yet to eat.</p>
<p>Patience, hope, and lots and lots of prayers&hellip;</p>
<p>And so, Amber continues on her way.</p>

		<p>Today was a good day. Amber&rsquo;s sisters and brother came to celebrate Easter with her, and her four grandparents came to join a bit later. Continued positive progress on her numbers, and so we continue to reduce various meds and therapies to see if she can self-regulate. Amber looked like a little angel today, &ldquo;wearing&rdquo; her beautiful Easter dress (draped over her in the bed). Her brother and sisters talked with her quite a bit, and got to see her open her eyes several times &ndash; for a couple minutes each time! She continues to move her right arm and leg, and a bit of her left leg, and a tiny bit of her left arm, including stretching out the right arm and grasping whatever is in her hand. She is still very heavily sedated, so we know she can&rsquo;t exactly see and hear us, but it feels like she knows we are here. Small victories&hellip;</p>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words &ndash; this is a tissue paper &ldquo;stained glass&rdquo; project Amber did at school last year, hanging in our window, reminding us of two things &ndash; what Easter is really all about, and what Amber is capable of.</p>
<p>Happy Easter, God bless.</p>
