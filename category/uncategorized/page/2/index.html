We're going to make this journey in Amber's Way &ndash; with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</h2>

<p>Let me first start with some words of thanks.  We truly appreciate all of the prayers, kind words, and support for Amber, for us, and for our family.  This is an incredibly difficult time for us, but your support helps us avoid completely slipping into despair, and being able to enjoy our time with Amber.  We read every comment on this blog and social media, every email, every letter, every IM, every text, and we listen to every voicemail.  We haven&rsquo;t had enough time or energy to respond to the vast majority as we would like, but we do appreciate every one.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s strangely calm right now.  No more chaos, frenzy.  No more trying to keep medical appointments or medications straight.  No more hustle and bustle from Metro North, through Grand Central, to the 6 uptown, to the 68th St station.  Just Caron and me, with Amber and the other children.  As weird as it is to say, this is somehow beautiful.</p>



<p>And it&rsquo;s a strange peace, too.  For the first time since March 22, we know what is coming.  There is no more question, no more rollercoaster of highs and lows.  And as terrible, as hard as this is, we are making sure we are focused on celebrating the time we have with Amber, these days and weeks that maybe we weren&rsquo;t initially supposed to have, and not mourning our loss before it happens.  Yes, of course, we have our moments of absolute despair &ndash; but when we look back on this, that is not what we want to remember.</p>



<p>Today, Amber received her First Reconciliation.  Normally, this would happen in January, to prepare for her First Communion which is in May &ndash; but we are fortunate enough to be able to celebrate both Sacraments with her now.  Amber will receive her First Communion on Saturday.</p>



<p>Father Tito has been part of our life for a very long time &mdash; I was in 2nd or 3rd grade (33 years ago!) when he began at St. Patrick&rsquo;s in Norwich.  Caron received her Sacrament of Confirmation from him, he married Caron and me, he performed the Baptism of all four of our children, and has given our older children (Marie and Brianna) the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Communion, which Amber is now receiving.  And, he gave Amber the Anointing of the Sick many months ago when this started, and again this week with this new downturn.  He has been a big part of so much of our life, and it is both fitting and comforting that he is part of this with us too.</p>



<p>Today, we had THE talk with Amber, while the other children were at school.  We&rsquo;ve been struggling with trying to figure out how much she understands, how to talk with her about it, what to say.  So we just asked her &ndash; &ldquo;do you understand what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;, &ldquo;do you know why we aren&rsquo;t going to MSK or CCMC anymore?&rdquo;, &ldquo;do you know why we are having you do your Sacraments early?&rdquo;, &ldquo;what do you think happens if that tumor keeps growing?&rdquo;.  After many really good answers, she says it.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Am I going to die?&rdquo;</p>



<p>She doesn&rsquo;t ask it like it&rsquo;s a revelation of any sort.  More like it&rsquo;s the obvious conclusion, and if she knew we were trying to get to that obvious point, she would have just said it earlier. </p>



<p>I can&rsquo;t quite describe how it felt, trying to talk about this.  It was terrible, terrifying.  It tore at my Soul with every word.  For her to respond in such an anti-climatic way was almost a relief.  She is not afraid, it is just the way it is.</p>



<p>We continued to talk about Heaven, which Amber described as Paradise.  She can&rsquo;t wait to see Uncle Ned (who passed in 2016) and Mo (our kitty who passed in 2012).  And apparently, you can get all the marshmallows that you want, and everyone is happy and healthy there.  We talked about how much we are going to miss her, but how time works different up there and she will barely blink before we are there with her.  It was such an incredibly sad conversation, and yet comforting to know that she isn&rsquo;t afraid.</p>



<p>We didn&rsquo;t talk about exactly how much time she has (because, well, we aren&rsquo;t exactly sure, and she has the literalness of a 7 year old) &ndash; but she understands that it isn&rsquo;t too long.  So, we started talking about what she wants.  At the top of her list is having tacos (just cheese, no meat) and Domino&rsquo;s Cheesy Bread for dinners; and visiting with her best friend Catherine.  She also wants to watch a movie and snuggle with Mom on the couch; to go back to the Boston Children&rsquo;s Museum with Dad (like we did last year); and to finally see her Uncle Keith and Auntie Mel who live in Texas with their children Noah and Autumn (the last time they visited she was still heavily sedated).  She told us that she wants people to remember her as a nice person, and to remember her story going through all of this.</p>



<p>Again, this conversation was very matter-of-fact.  Aside from the context, this was like any other conversation we would have had.  It is just so strange, so surreal, to be talking like this.  It is both the most disturbing conversation I&rsquo;ve ever had, and the most comforting.  Superficially, I am just talking with my daughter.  Internally, my Soul was drowning in despair and burning with fear.</p>



<p>But then, the day continues, almost like any other.  Her friend Catherine did come over to visit, and it made Amber happy (I love her laugh so much).  Amber is comfortable, happy; if I hadn&rsquo;t seen the MRI myself, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accept the truth.  She isn&rsquo;t even complaining about her minor headaches right now.  Aside from the physical constraints she has been dealing with from the beginning, and taking a few naps every day, she is just normal Amber.  And we know we are blessed for this to be the case.</p>



<p>We have started reading this blog to Amber, with the whole family, from the beginning.  We&rsquo;ll try to read ~10 posts every night. I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll make it through all 120 (now 121) posts, but we want to hear Amber&rsquo;s reaction to all of this, to capture anything from her perspective that we may have missed.  But just as much, we want her to know how many people have commented on these posts, and what they&rsquo;ve said.  Many of you have been following this blog for a long time, and have left comments.  If there is anything you would like us to convey directly to Amber, please feel free to leave it in the comments of this post. We will read these comments to her right away, and won&rsquo;t wait until we get to this 121st post.</p>

		<p>It is with very heavy hearts that we share some difficult news.</p>
<p>Amber is home with us, happy and comfortable. However, after a number of discussions with the doctors, we have come to accept that this disease is progressing extremely rapidly, and there is nothing more that can be done to stop it. She is home with us right now and that is where she will remain until Our Father in Heaven calls her to his home.</p>
<p>We wish we had good news to share, but it is not. In fact, writing this, I am deeply struggling because there are so many raw emotions and thoughts swirling through us &mdash; our heads, our hearts, and our bodies &mdash; it&rsquo;s all-consuming of our beings, and of our souls. My being . . . and my soul, was put here on Earth because of my children. I am their mother; their provider, their nurturer, and their protector. And as her parents, this is something that, no matter how hard we tried, we could not protect our child from.</p>
<p>We met with Dr. Gillan and Dr. Martin yesterday (Monday) around 10:30 AM. They brought us into a conference room with a couple of other nurses and a child life specialist. Dr. Martin pulls up the <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/30/day-40-bracing-ourselves/">MRI from April</a> on the big screen, which was taken shortly after the first surgery where the original tumor was removed, and then he pulls up the <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/12/08/day-262-speed-bump/">MRI taken this weekend</a> to show us the comparison. The recent MRI will forever be embedded in our minds. Essentially, the entire right side of her brain has been overcome by this disease, this tumor, and the tumor and swelling is now putting pressure on the left part of her brain, skewing and compressing the relatively straight gap that splits the two halves of the brain into a curved hairline. You cannot even see the brain stem or the ventricles, as they have been compressed so significantly. With something like this, an aggressive Grade 4 Glioblastoma, it is hard to say how long Amber has. Dr. Martin indicates most likely days to weeks, but not months.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had so many doctors over the past few days as well as the doctors at MSK give a surprised &ldquo;Huh&rdquo; once they meet Amber, having just reviewed the MRIs before walking in the room, and we now really understand why this is their first word. They all expected to see a little girl in severe pain, barely functioning, and instead find a little girl breathing, talking, smiling, walking, not in pain, and still giving her parents sass like any 7 year old&hellip; how is this even medically possible? How is it that she is even still functioning?</p>
<p>Dr Gillan, Dr Martin, and the others at CCMC have learned much about us over the past 265 days, and were prepared to discuss this with us in the way they knew we needed. They were very direct with us, and walked us through what could be considered as options, but explained the downsides of each as they would impact us. The images and records have been reviewed by many doctors at several institutions that we trust, and there is agreement on the options (or lack of) currently available. One option was surgery to remove half of her brain, which is very risky and very likely leaves Amber with a very low quality of life &ndash; and, doesn&rsquo;t cure her of the cancer, just buys more time to find a cure. Another option was to take a chance on another clinical trial, knowing that the trial we did already try was the &ldquo;most promising&rdquo; and did not work, and that the only other potentially viable trials will require significant travel, meaning a very high likelihood of Amber leaving this world while she is in a foreign place, nowhere near the people she loves most.</p>
<p>Or, the option that we have chosen &ndash; to go home and have her with us, keeping her comfortable and happy, enjoying what time remains with the people who love her. We struggled greatly with this, so much more than I can express here, but have decided that this is the best and only option that makes sense &mdash; Home here with her family before going to our ultimate home in Heaven.</p>
<p>Amber is doing well right now. She is very tired, sometimes continues to complain of a mild headache over her right eyebrow that comes and goes, and her right pupil is still a bit larger than her left. The hospital sent us home with anti seizure medicine, steroids, and stomach medicine. Amber might be capable of going to school, but due to her increasing tiredness and not knowing when symptoms may strike, we just feel that it is best for us to be with her at all times. We will have Hospice at our side, and are being educated in pain management. We will make sure she remains happy and comfortable, to the end.</p>
<p>We selfishly want our baby girl to remain here with us on Earth. We know she could change this world for the better. Heaven knows we need that. At first we were mad that what we&rsquo;ve been praying for didn&rsquo;t come true; for Amber to be miraculously healed and cured of brain cancer. But perhaps, we actually did have a miracle. Perhaps Amber was supposed to leave us on <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/03/22/day-1-carons-morning/">March 22nd, 2018</a>. But instead, was given an extra 9 months to be with us and to enjoy our time together. And for this time we&rsquo;ve had, we are truly grateful to God.</p>
<p>Matt and I ask that you still pray for Amber. Pray for her to get through these next days to weeks with comfort and peace, and to embrace the new life that awaits ahead.</p>

		<p>Just a short update this morning.</p>
<p>We are going to stay at CCMC another night.  Amber did well last night (well, at least as well as someone can do when being woken up every hour for checkups), and the steroid seems to be helping relieve the pressure.  The steroid isn&rsquo;t a cure &ndash; it reduces the brain inflammation, but does nothing to the tumor.  So we are still assembling the plan, collecting options given the current state of things from various hospitals and medical centers and hope to have something more to work with tomorrow.  We&rsquo;ll post more as we figure it out.</p>

		<p>Today was the annual Christmas Concert at the kids&rsquo; school. Amber, Ryan, Brianna, and Marie have been practicing their songs for weeks, and were ready to get up on stage. But, Amber wasn&rsquo;t destined to perform today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we had a follow-up with the <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/11/25/day-249-being-thankful/">opthalmologist</a>. As the exam was wrapping up, and she told us that Amber&rsquo;s eyes looked great, she took one quick last look and just sort of made an off-hand comment to the effect of &ldquo;huh, she seems to have a <i>very</i> slight difference in pupil size&rdquo;, but didn&rsquo;t think it was anything of concern.</p>
<p>This morning after breakfast, because of that comment yesterday, Caron was looking at Amber&rsquo;s eyes and noticed that the pupil of Amber&rsquo;s right eye was a little larger than her left. On one hand, this immediately set off alarms for us both &ndash; when Amber was first brought to the ER at Backus Hospital, <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/03/22/day-1-carons-morning/">262 days ago</a>, the first thing Dr. Adams noticed was her enlarged right pupil; and then, during our <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/05/10/day-50-were-home/">next 50 days</a> at CCMC the pupils were checked all the time for signs of pressure in the brain. On the other hand &ndash; we have witnessed this poor little girl go through so much, physically and mentally, that it can be tough to determine the right level of concern. But, even with the news this past week, this difference in the pupils was unexpected, so we called CCMC. After a quick exchange and deciding that while it /might/ not be anything of concern, it&rsquo;s better to err on the side of caution, I brought Amber up to the ER at CCMC for a quick check, while Caron brought the other three children to their concert.</p>
<p>Once at the ER, they immediately start checking out Amber&rsquo;s eyes, getting her vitals, <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/12/03/day-257-a-let-down-day/">reviewing the latest notes from MSK</a>, and I end up repeating the story of the past 262 days several times as each new person enters the room, as it is probably faster for me to tell the story than for them to read the encyclopedic volumes of notes to get up to speed.</p>
<p>After some challenges getting the most recent MRI from MSK, they decide to put her through a quick CT Scan. Unfortunately, they do see some unexpected changes in the tumor/mass, which is causing some irritation and swelling, putting some pressure on the brain.</p>
<p>So we start discussing options while waiting for radiology to be ready for us for an MRI. Dependant on the results of the MRI, we might be considering something as simple as a steroid to reduce the inflammation, or might be considering immediate surgery. Or, possibly the worst case, doing nothing at all.</p>
<p>So then off into the MRI for the one-hour scan. As always, Amber is a trooper. She doesn&rsquo;t want to be sedated, no movie or music, doesn&rsquo;t even want ear protection (but she does eventually have to give in on that one).</p>
<p>Following the MRI, Amber has been admitted to the PICU, where we are right now (about 11PM). Amber is sleeping, receiving a steroid drip. We will determine in the morning if this works and gives us the time to develop and pursue a plan (as we have been anticipating), or if we go right into surgery tomorrow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather surreal to be back here in the PICU, where we spent the first two weeks of this journey, starting 262 days ago. Nurse Alex is here, as well as Nurse Steve and Respitory Tech Craig. There are new faces too, of course, but these familiar faces are weirdly comforting. We wish we weren&rsquo;t here at all, yet there is nowhere we&rsquo;d feel more &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a long night. We hope that this is just a speed bump on the way to a better plan, but we won&rsquo;t know till morning. Until then, we pray. There is nothing else Caron and I can do; this is in God&rsquo;s hands. So as we have before, we pray that He gives strength and clarity to the skilled medical professionals who are determining the best course of action for Amber. And we pray that Amber rests comfortably and that God strengthens her for whatever comes next. And Caron and I will figure out what&rsquo;s next after we hear from the team tomorrow morning.</p>

		<p>Wish we had better news to share with you today. In a nutshell, the day was a big let down. Amber had her MRI and unfortunately, the results came back with what we were fearing &ndash; growth. Because the Pembrolizmaub is not working, they decided not to have Amber do the infusion today, nor any others as she will not be on this particular clinical trial anymore.</p>
<p>We have been in contact with Dr. Gillan from CCMC and she has some backup plans in the works. One possibility is two oral medications: Chemo and a medication that will target GBM stem cells.</p>
<p>And meanwhile still, Dr. Gillan and the doctors from MSK are investigating other potential clinical trials.</p>
<p>We are grateful to have MSK and CCMC working with us, joining us in the fight. But still &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; I&rsquo;m trying to be open minded and I&rsquo;m trying not to be mad. But right now, I&rsquo;m angry, sad, defeated, numb, exhausted, heart broken. This sucks. This sucks BIG TIME. This poor little girl. For what happened to her 8 months ago to what&rsquo;s happening to her right now. It&rsquo;s hard to hang onto hope when &ldquo;hope&rdquo; is literally a tiny little shred of a string . . . that&rsquo;s fraying . . .</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 3 weeks since our <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/11/05/day-229-maybe/">last post.</a>&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been an interesting few weeks, with ups and downs.&nbsp; But most importantly, this week was Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Even with the roller-coaster that life has been lately, we made sure to stop and enjoy the long Thanksgiving weekend as a family, and to really focus on what we are thankful for.</p>



<p>Since our last post, Amber had her third infusion 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; The infusion went smoothly, but while we were at MSK we discussed some pain Amber has been complaining about in her right eye.&nbsp; We were able to see the oncological ophthalmologist, who took a look and saw nothing immediately concerning, but gave us some ointment for a stye that had developed on Amber&rsquo;s right eye.&nbsp; As the next couple of days continued, the pain increased, and Amber came home early from school twice.&nbsp; MSK advised us to see our pediatrician, who also didn&rsquo;t see anything that should be causing pain, but he immediately got us into the ophthalmologist at Yale-New Haven.&nbsp; After almost two hours of different doctors and assistants looking in Amber&rsquo;s eyes, they came back with their findings &mdash; she has dry eyes!&nbsp; So, we started giving her some simple eye-drops, and this has helped significantly.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t made the pain totally disappear, but it has made a huge difference.&nbsp; We are very thankful to be able to reduce her pain, and not have this be something more serious.</p>



<p>This past weekend, we got to visit the residence of <a href="http://www.littleaudreysantofoundation.com/">Little Audrey Santo</a>. Audrey died in 2007, but experienced miracles and may some day be Canonized.&nbsp; We met Audrey&rsquo;s mom, and talked about Audrey&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Reverend Peter Joyce joined us, and gave a blessing over Amber, asking for Audrey&rsquo;s intercession.&nbsp; Having Father Joyce is quite coincidental &ndash; he delivered the Wedding Mass when my brother got married in 2012, and the Funeral Mass when my brother died in 2016.&nbsp; There have been many similar &ldquo;coincidences&rdquo;  over the past 249 days, so maybe his appearance at this most recent event in our lives wasn&rsquo;t just accidental, but rather, is evidence  of some larger plan in the works.&nbsp; Seeing Father Joyce, having Amber receive a blessing, and praying for Audrey&rsquo;s intercession was all together an incredible experience, and we are very thankful to have some really good friends (who have helped us quite a bit through this entire ordeal), who set this up and joined us.</p>



<p>And then we had this beautiful Thanksgiving weekend.&nbsp; We hosted (and by &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I really mean Caron &mdash; I just try to stay out of the way) my parents, my aunt, Caron&rsquo;s parents, her grandmother, and her brother and sister-in-law &mdash; along with our own family of 6.&nbsp; It was a beautiful time, some time to relax and enjoy a meal with the family, and ponder what we are most thankful for (I&rsquo;ll say more on that a little later).&nbsp; On Friday, while many people were enjoying the chaos of the shopping malls, the six of us went and found our Christmas tree, and then decorated it on Saturday.</p>



<p>It was while decorating the tree that it hit me, what I&rsquo;m really most thankful for right now.</p>



<p> As I&rsquo;m watching the kids hang their special ornaments, I forgot for just a moment that Amber has a serious illness, most likely deadly.&nbsp; For a few minutes, she is &ldquo;just&rdquo; one of my children &ndash; laughing, enjoying herself, talking about Christmas.&nbsp; But then I remember, and struggle to maintain my composure as I realize that statistically, the odds are against Amber being with us to do this again next year.&nbsp; I remember that right now, the tumor is most likely still growing, and that we may be considering alternative plans over the next couple weeks.</p>



<p>But then I also remember that we have this time together.&nbsp; <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/03/22/day-1-carons-morning/">March 22</a> could have been it, could have the last time we had Amber with us.&nbsp; But she is still here.&nbsp; She is still happy, and we still have the possibility for a positive outcome.&nbsp; We have our whole family, right here, right now.</p>



<p>And so, even though the past 249 days have been difficult for all of us, and Amber most of all, I am thankful for this time we have together.&nbsp; However short or long it may be, we are going to appreciate every moment we have.</p>



<p>We now look to the next MRI, scheduled for next Monday (8 days away).&nbsp; This one should provide some direction &mdash; either the treatment <em>is not</em> working, the tumor is progressing, and so we need to consider alternative plans; or (somewhat less likely)&nbsp;the treatment <em>is</em> working and the &ldquo;growth&rdquo; that was apparent in the previous MRI was just &ldquo;pseudo-progression&rdquo; and we will start seeing the tumor shrink.&nbsp; So for now we pray simply to be pointed to the right path, whichever gives Amber the best chances.<br></p>

		<p>Just when we think that we are in for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; type of result, life reminds us that their is always room for &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Amber had her MRI today. The results show some increased growth since last time, still in the same location as the original tumor. We were hoping to see some reduction, so of course this is disappointing. But, the Doctor gave us some interesting detail &ndash; it is not uncommon for this medicine to cause some inflammation of the tumor at first, and this would show up as we saw in today&rsquo;s scan.</p>
<p>So unfortunately &hellip; we are squarely in &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; territory. It&rsquo;s possible the medicine is having no effect and the tumor has grown a bit, and it&rsquo;s possible the medicine is having a positive effect and has inflamed the tumor.</p>
<p>We had a good conversation with the Doctor, basically coming down to two options: we could abandon the current treatment and move to something else, or we can hold steady for now and continue to monitor the growth. More conversation will happen at next week&rsquo;s appointment, but we are already fairly settled that we will continue with the current treatment for now.</p>
<p>So &hellip; &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; we are making progress?  We pray that we are.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">MRI</span></strong></p>
<p>Monday is the day.&nbsp; Her much anticipated MRI.&nbsp; Not sure what it will show &mdash;&nbsp; 1 tumor the same size? 1 tumor, bigger size?&nbsp; 1 tumor, smaller size?&nbsp; OR maybe &mdash; Multiple tumors?&nbsp; Or maybe &mdash; no tumors?&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s too soon to actually see a &ldquo;difference&rdquo;, or then again, maybe not.&nbsp; No matter what, Monday is the day &mdash; The Truth Machine will show something one way or the other.&nbsp; Please pray for us . . .</p>
<p>There is a Holy Hour for Amber at our church &mdash;&nbsp;<a href="http://stmarybaltic.com/">Saint Mary Church</a> in Baltic, on Sunday, November 4th, from 7PM-8PM.</p>
<p>And just a side note.&nbsp; November 4th is also my birthday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve already received my very special gift:&nbsp; Amber Grace, alive and kicking.&nbsp; But I want more.&nbsp; I bet you know what I&rsquo;ll be wishing for when I blow out those candles . . .</p>

		<p>Today was another trip to MSK in NYC, for Amber&rsquo;s second dose of pembrolizumab.&nbsp; As always, this started with checking Amber&rsquo;s vitals, doing some blood work, then waiting around for a while until a room is available for the infusion.&nbsp; Amber had a little trouble with it this time, getting some flushed cheeks, a minor fever, and a little stomach ache.&nbsp; Nothing unexpected, nothing major (the list of potential side effects is very long and scary), but still meant needing to hang around a bit longer for observation &ndash; plus Benadryl, Tylenol, Famotidine, and Ceftriaxone (and antibiotic, just in case).&nbsp; Amber&rsquo;s a trooper though, taking it all in stride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of our time in the hospital room at Connecticut Children&rsquo;s Medical Center.&nbsp; The beeping of the machines, Amber being connected up to the machine supplying her medicine, her lying in the bed napping.&nbsp; But beyond all of that, just as I was at CCMC, I am again amazed by the level of care the nurses provide.&nbsp; Not just the knowledge they have in their field, but the human, caring, supportive approach they take with Amber, and with us.&nbsp; At CCMC, our emotional state survived only through the help of the nurses; and while we certainly hope to not have to spend <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/05/10/day-50-were-home/">50 days</a> in a room here at MSK (or any other hospital), I see MSK&rsquo;s nurses share that same critical quality.</p>
<p>We also got the results of the <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/09/25/day-188-a-rainy-day-in-nyc/">genetic testing</a> from MSK&rsquo;s genetics team.&nbsp; All the tests came back negative.&nbsp; This is a mixed blessing &ndash; on the positive side, this means that there is little chance of our other children being at risk due to genetics; however, this also means we still do not have any clear cause for all of this, and so cannot target her treatment to that cause.</p>
<p>So, we keep doing what we&rsquo;re doing &ndash; weekly trips into NYC, weekly OT and PT sessions, watching Amber all the time for anything that causes concern, keeping her happy and moving forward, and praying &ndash; lots and lots of prayer.</p>
