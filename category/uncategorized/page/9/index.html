We're going to make this journey in Amber's Way &ndash; with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</h2>

		<p>Oatmeal and spinach are great, but &hellip; sometimes you just need a little bacon! Amber started the day with Speech Therapy bringing in some new breakfast items &ndash; things that are harder to chew and swallow, to see if Amber is ready for a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; menu. Waffles, whole strawberries, and &hellip; bacon! The bacon was a little tough, but Amber gnawed her way through. Following the successful breakfast test, Amber&rsquo;s menu has been upgraded; she now can order hotdogs and hamburgers, carrot and celery sticks, chicken nuggets. She still needs to eat slowly and carefully, but it&rsquo;s nice to have her eating pretty much back to normal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Amber has caught a bit of a cold along the way though. Lots of sniffling and coughing, enough to upset her stomach. So, breakfast didn&rsquo;t stay in her stomach very long. But, the other meals stayed down, and she is doing well.</p>
<p>Then, as usual, on to OT and PT. Man, I wish I had Amber&rsquo;s perseverance when it comes to exercise. An hour on the swings working her arms and balance, and an hour kneeling and standing, kicking her new rainbow-colored kickball.</p>
<p>We are just a handful of days away from the next big milestones &ndash; Monday is the MRI to see how the brain is doing and determine if there is any primary tumor regrowth (we won&rsquo;t get the results until Tuesday, though), and Thursday (May 3) is the surgery to replace the skull flap. And then, we begin <a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/03/day-13-the-elephant-and-the-whale/">eating the whale</a> shortly after.</p>
<p>But hopefully, with a little more perseverance over the next 2 weeks, we&rsquo;ll have enough of the elephant eaten that we can come home before we tackle that whale. I think that&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;ll need to renew Amber&rsquo;s appetite, and re-energize all of our spirits.</p>

		<p>After a bit of a rough start to the morning &mdash; Amber threw her breakfast and supplemental feed up (her sibs shared some type of coughing/mucus germ) . . . She persevered. PT with Lauren and crew showed us just how bad Amber wants out of here. Not only did she kneel in a high kneel position (and at some points unsupported), she STOOD UP to stand against her bed with Lauren and Shannon supporting her! Yes, stood up and stayed that way for a few minutes!!! After that, after all that hard work, she literally crawled up into bed!!!</p>
<p>* SUPER AMBER GRACE!!!! *</p>
<p>Once situated back in bed, Amber had a lovely visit from a Volunteer named Michelle and her 14 year young dog named Carina. Carina got in bed with Amber and Amber was in her glory!</p>
<p>After some lunch of mac and cheese and spinach (still on a spinach kick &mdash; getting strong from it (and it&rsquo;s obviously working!)), and bit of chocolate munchkin for dessert, it was time to go outside for some Vitamin D.</p>
<p>Little miracles and blessings everyday. Thank you God, Mary, and Jesus &mdash; Amber&rsquo;s strength is heightened by you. And thanks to you; our families, friends, aquaintences, and even kind folks that don&rsquo;t even know us (officially anyway) &mdash; your prayers and positive thoughts . . . we feel them! Our love to you all! &#128156;</p>

		<hr>
<p><i><i><i><i></i></i></i></i><i><i><i><i></i></i></i></i></p>
<p>Today was a busy day. After attempting some (almost) 5 week old homework, Amber had a small speech therapy with a fill-in for Sara named Kiersten during breakfast.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Catie came in and removed the remaining stitches and staples.</p>
<p>We had PT down on Floor 5, and were able to see Amber swing. When she was sitting there she had her feet on the floor and was swinging the swing on her own, even her left leg and foot were helping a little! Then we got on the floor in a high kneel and pushed and pulled a big ball back and forth 5 times!</p>
<p>After that we had a nice visit with Grammy and Grammy back at her room. They brought up the Relic of the True Cross from Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral where we said a couple beautiful prayers with Amber before her lunch. During the prayers, while Amber was in the wheelchair, I noticed she was struggling with her right hand to get her left arm and hand on to the top of her tray. I went over and helped place her left arm and hand there for her. I was thinking she was uncomfortable with it being on her lap, but no, that&rsquo;s not what it was. As soon as I did that for her, she promptly takes her right hand and feeds those fingers through the non-responsive left fingers so that she could properly pray (out loud) those prayers with folded hands. That &mdash; that was tough. I choked out the last of the prayers and went to the opposite corner of the room to cry and try to put myself back together. Remember my post from a couple days ago about her. . .<i> innocence and sweetness,</i> yeah, same exact feeling going through me again. These moments are tremendously pure, but utterly heart wrenching.</p>
<p>After going outside to blow bubbles and eat some diced peaches, Grammy and Grampy said their goodbyes and Amber and I went back to her room where she took a much needed nap.</p>
<p>After said nap which lasted about a half hour, Caitlin from OT was ready for her. Down to Floor 6 we went to the little gym. Caitlin had Amber on the mat sitting playing a Grilling Game. At a couple points, Amber was sitting unsupported! She was able to do that all by herself while keeping her neck strong! Then she pushed and pulled a big ball a few times in a high kneel.</p>
<p>Her &ldquo;button&rdquo; (G-Tube) is still really bothering her which I feel like is delaying her with forward moving therapies. I think she&rsquo;d be willing and wanting to do so much more if it wasn&rsquo;t for the pain and soreness of the G-Tube.</p>
<p>All in all though, a good day for Amber, whose so unbelievably strong &amp; tough!</p>

		<p>Another fairly quiet day. No Physical, Occupational, or Speech Therapy today, just me and Amber spending the day together. But between meals, G-tube feedings, medications, checking vitals, it&rsquo;s amazing how quickly the day flies by. We spent some time in the morning coloring together, and watched some Minecraft videos on YouTube together (she still has to explain to me everytime why she wants to watch someone else play, instead of just playing the game herself). And later in the afternoon, we got to take a walk outside, in the sun, with Mem and Pep visiting. A short nap afterwards, then her brother and sisters came to visit.</p>
<p>But during the quieter moments, scattered throughout the day, she would gather up the courage to ask a question or two. Big questions. The Questions. The questions no parent wants to ever have to address. The questions that show just how much your child does understand what&rsquo;s going on, and how little you can actually shield them from.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why me?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>
<p>When can I go home?</p>
<p>Will this happen to my children?</p>
<p>And bigger questions, that I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to write here.</p>
<p>And of course, she wants answers. So I do my best to answer, to be honest, but to do so at a 6 year old level &ndash; and learn along the way that I apparently don&rsquo;t give 6 year olds enough credit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard. But it is necessary. She wants to know. She deserves to know. And she is showing the bravery and uncanny maturity of someone who understands there is trouble ahead, and is bracing herself to face it, head on. She is still a 6 year old, and she is scared, but it is clear to me that she knows 100% that Caron and I are with her every step, that she is not alone in this. And so a reasonable level of honest detail from us, and a ton of love and reassurance, helps keep her courage.</p>
<p>And her Faith is strong too &ndash; I have been saying the Rosary when I stay overnight with her (alternating with Caron), usually after she falls asleep. Caron, though, has been praying with her before she falls asleep. Earlier this week, Amber asked me if I would &ldquo;pray the Rosary over her, like Mama does&rdquo;, because she understands that we are asking for God&rsquo;s help, through Mary, to help her get healthy. She knows that as long as we ask, God will help us.</p>
<p>Possibly most intriguing to me, though, is seeing her take ownership of the things in her control. Today, lunch was pasta with a side of mushy spinach. Surprisingly, she dove right into the spinach, ate up as much as she could. She never would have touched spinach like this at home, so I asked her why she was eating it instead of the pasta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, spinach makes you strong. And when I get strong, I can go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God, please grant Amber strength for the journey ahead. I can&rsquo;t wait for Amber to come home &hellip;</p>

		<p><i>As Matt noted reading this post before I published it &ndash; this post is a rollercoaster, just like the journey we are on.</i></p>
<p>Day 31 . . .</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we are on day 31. On one hand, it&rsquo;s all been a blur because I can&rsquo;t believe we are already on day 31. However, my mind, body, energy, and even my spirit, are just exhausted . . . because it&rsquo;s been 31 days. That&rsquo;s me. So how does Amber feel? Her mind, body, energy, and most likely her spirit, are different; injured; foreign. My poor baby girl, this must be all too much for her. And all she wants to do is just go home. We tell her it&rsquo;s only a couple more weeks, but is it? Are we all just naive and optimistic, when we really shouldn&rsquo;t be? I&rsquo;m trying to be hopeful in all this but it is truly hard. For me, it&rsquo;s the unknown that&rsquo;s defeating me and bringing me down.</p>
<p>I try not to use the word &ldquo;hate&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s ugly. But I hate this situation so much. I hate seeing Amber suffer. I hate seeing the kids on her floor, Floor 8 (The Cancer Ward) suffering, and I hate for all kids in this hospital to be suffering. Kids are innocent, and this should NOT be happening to them. It&rsquo;s just not right.</p>
<p>Amber&rsquo;s been in pain after having the G-Tube put in but I have to chuckle because no matter how much discomfort she&rsquo;s in, she is so darn polite! She&rsquo;s cying from being jostled around and she still says her pleases and thank you&rsquo;s to us and the nurses. I laugh because it&rsquo;s cute but inside my heart it breaks. It breaks for her innocence and sweetness. And as I write this, I cry . . . because it&rsquo;s just not right. It should be me in her place, not her.</p>
<p>There is so much to worry about and I&rsquo;m trying not to let it consume me, but it&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>Thank God for Matt. My rock, my heart, my partner and my love. When I feel down he picks me up. I honestly couldn&rsquo;t ask for a more perfect partner to be by my side during this topsey-turvey nightmare. He gives me strength when I need it so that I can have that extra strength for Amber; for our children; for him. Him and I, we&rsquo;ve got this &mdash; together, as a team with Amber. God, I thank you for him;  for them.</p>

		<p>Today was a fairly routine day. Which is unusual, because we don&rsquo;t really have much of a regular routine. But, one is starting to develop, and having some regularity, some predictability, is a good thing.</p>
<p>After a breakfast of oatmeal, Amber and I did a little bit of coloring. Again, she did a great job coloring inside the lines (better than me, anyway!), so that right-hand control and vision are recovering well. She can&rsquo;t do it long, though, before it tires her hand out, but we are getting further each time.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-299 alignnone size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915.jpg" width="1559" height="1670" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915.jpg 1559w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-280x300.jpg 280w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-956x1024.jpg 956w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-768x823.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_20180420_10491626380613076158696915-1434x1536.jpg 1434w" sizes="(max-width: 1559px) 100vw, 1559px"></p>
<p>But, as always, I like to push things a bit. At the bottom of the page she was coloring were a couple of words, so I asked her to read them. It took her a few seconds, but very clearly (and correctly) read them out as &ldquo;Queen Cat&rdquo;! This is an improvement from a few days ago, where reading was a frustrating exercise for her.</p>
<p>Occupational Therapy and Speech Therapy came to visit shortly after, and they brought Amber down to the Play Room to play some Connect Four. Between having her sit upright for the game, making her right hand support her left hand to pick up and drop the checkers, and having Amber speak to ask for more pieces or state how many were in a row, they were really pushing her &ndash; and she was pushing right through quite well, and having fun too.</p>
<p>She was pretty tired after, but enjoyed a pasta lunch, and then a trip to the PT gym, where she got to ride on a swing while exercising!</p>
<p>Finally a short nap before dinner, and some quiet TV time before prayers and bed.</p>
<p>She misses home terribly, misses her cat Rea, her friends, her toys. She even told us she wants to come home to<a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/04/18/day-28-the-voice-of-an-angel/"> catch up on homework</a>, because she misses school so much. And unfortunately, we have at least a few more weeks in this hospital room. But, with a little bit of routine to make life less chaotic, she is establishing her own &ldquo;new normal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Her courage and strength amaze me.</p>

		<p><a href="https://ambersway.com/2018/03/22/day-1-carons-morning/">Four weeks ago today</a>, I carried an unconscious, lifeless Amber into the Backus Hospital Emergency Department, not having a clue what kind of journey was beginning for us. And worse, not sure if I would ever see her awake again. Four weeks later, Amber is not only awake, but is smiling, talking, and giving me sass. Yes, still a long road ahead. But for both Caron and me, our baseline has been dramatically reset; we are far more appreciative of every minute, of every action than we ever would have imagined.</p>
<p>Today was another day of progress, with several new &ldquo;firsts&rdquo;: sitting on a toilet, blowing bubbles, eating three meals (pancakes for breakfast, mac and cheese for lunch, and pasta for dinner), playing a board game. 30 days ago, these would have been a normal part of the day; today, I am ecstatic with each of these! She continues to make great progress day after day, and we will do whatever it takes to keep that momentum moving.</p>
<p>Her strength amazes me. She continues to work hard, until she falls asleep exhausted at the end of the day. But she also still gives me &ldquo;the look&rdquo;, that smirk and eye roll, the &ldquo;did you really just say/do that daddy?&rdquo; expression, reminding me that she is very much my little girl.</p>
<p>Every day she understands a little more about what is going on. Her biggest personal challenge right now is just that she misses home so much, she just wants to get back to her bed, with her cat Rea, with her toys, with her family. This brings her to tears multiple times a day &ndash; but it is also a source of motivation for her, because she knows that to go home, she has to &ldquo;get strong&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s what the hospital is helping her do.</p>
<p>She is a 6 year old (sorry, 6 &ldquo;and a half&rdquo; year old) supergirl.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we have commented many times on our ongoing experience here with Connecticut Children&rsquo;s Medical Center. But in this post marking our four week milestone, I&rsquo;d like to express special thanks to the people at the Backus Hospital Emergency Department; Dr Adams, the ED team, the Lifestar team, and any others that March 22 morning &ndash; your quick assessment and actions that morning were the difference between hope and despair for us. I cannot express the depth of my appreciation for your work, your skill, and the fact that Amber is here with us today because of you. I ask that the prayerful readers of this post join me in praying that God bless these medical professionals, and all medical professionals around the globe, that they may have the strength, clarity, and will to apply their skill everytime the need arises, providing great care as they did for Amber.</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if she&rsquo;d ever be able to speak again. It was a fear that ran through my mind constantly these past 3 1/2 weeks. It was possible right? I mean she had an unknown tumor that burst which caused a major stroke and 2 brain surgeries. So the possibility of not speaking again (among other fears) was right up there on my list of possible outcomes from all this.</p>
<p>I can tell you in fact that Amber has the voice of an angel. It is soft, sweet, gentle, and. . . well, angelic. It&rsquo;s hers, it&rsquo;s our Amber&rsquo;s, and I will forever thank God for it.</p>
<p>Last night Amber told me that she misses home. I can&rsquo;t blame her. I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine everything she has and is going through and how absolutely terrifying it must be for her. &ldquo;What do you miss most about home?&rdquo; I ask. She starts to cry. . . &ldquo;Rea&rdquo; she says. Rea is our 16 1/2 year old cat and Amber&rsquo;s buddy.</p>
<p>This morning Amber says &ldquo;I want to go home&hellip;&rdquo; I cringe a little because I know what&rsquo;s coming next. &ldquo;Why do you want to go home?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Because I want to do my homework&rdquo;. That response completely sideswipes me!! Ha Ha!! Does she really maturely understand enough to put the fact of how long she&rsquo;s been in here with how much school she&rsquo;s missed which results in just how much work she needs to make up?  Perhaps so.</p>
<p>Her G-Tube spot is still sore, especially when Lauren from PT got her in and out of beds, wheelchairs, and floor mats. We got to do PT down on the 6th floor where their gym is. On the wall in there it says &ldquo;Super Heroes in Training&rdquo;. Ain&rsquo;t that the truth!</p>
<p>After a shower, Amber was exhausted but stayed awake enough to enjoy her 1st lunch tray meal! After some bites of Mac and Cheese, carrots, and chicken, she washed it all down with apple juice from a straw! She did so well that she has advanced to 3 soft food meals a day AND soft snacks and clear liquids with Matt or I!!!</p>
<p>I have to say that I am in awe of Amber Grace. She is so brave and so tough. I cannot thank God enough for her and for her being here with us today. I also cannot thank you all enough for your continued prayers, love, and support through this tumultuous journey. It helps us more than you will ever know. . . &#128156;</p>

		<p>Amber&rsquo;s G-Tube placement was a success. She was in a bit of discomfort during the night and a bit of today. However, the more annoying thing that bothered her today was wearing her helmet &mdash; which aggravated her healing (and very itchy) scalp.</p>
<p>After some OT on the mat that consisted of playing Legos and Squigz with our fill-in therapist Erin, Amber ended the session in her chair. She did well in the chair for a while. . . but that poor itchy scalp, being contained in a warm stifling helmet, was not making Amber a happy camper anymore. Once back in bed, helmetless, with a very much needed gentle head massage, and then cold damp facecloth, Amber was back to her content self.</p>
<p>A few hours later it was time for PT and ST together. The therapists were surprised and amazed by Amber&rsquo;s words and communication! Amber went down with Lauren on the floor mat and worked on building her neck muscles. Lauren seemed pleasantly surprised at Amber&rsquo;s controlled neck movements; an improvement since Friday. After some more PT, it was time for ST. Sara asked the question Amber has been waiting to hear since Saturday. . . &ldquo;Amber are you hungry?&rdquo;. Her eyes lit up with a big nod. But Sara wasn&rsquo;t letting her off the hook &ldquo;You have to tell me Amber, are you hungry?&rdquo;. . . Amber looks at Sara, starts to nod again but catches it, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;. Sara gives her a list of items she can choose from and Amber settles on &ldquo;Vanilla Pudding&rdquo;. Next question was if she wanted something to drink. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Amber chose &ldquo;Apple Juice&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After Sara came back with the items, she had Amber begin with the pudding. Sara took a spoonful, and Amber took a bite. Sara scooped up another spoonful and asked if Amber could feed it to herself. A head nod and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, so Sara hands it to Amber who proceeds to give herself a proper bite. Like, a direct hit into her mouth bite! After a few more like this Sara thinks out loud saying &ldquo;I wonder if we should try Graham Crackers? Amber do you like Graham Crackers?&rdquo;. Amber nods and says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I run and grab some Graham Crackers and hand them to Sara. While Sara breaks off a piece she reminds Amber not to shove the whole thing in her mouth &mdash; and she doesn&rsquo;t. Amber takes a perfect Amber-sized bite, chews it and swallows. Takes another bite, chews and swallows. Now if I wasn&rsquo;t Amber&rsquo;s mom and didn&rsquo;t know the backstory of the fact that Amber hasn&rsquo;t had solid food now for 27 days, I&rsquo;d think this is just another healthy kid having a plain old typical snack. What she did was so effortless!</p>
<p>Rockstar. That&rsquo;s what they all called Amber. After the Graham Crackers was Apple Juice, which Sara started off using a spoon for but by the end Amber was sipping from the cup. After some sips and a cough, she had some more. Then, she was done. . . She pointed to the bed and told them she was &ldquo;tired&rdquo;. She did well, really well. The girl deserves a break!</p>
<p>All I can say is, that&rsquo;s my girl, that&rsquo;s my Rockstar! Sara said that she is ready to try a lunch tray meal tomorrow!!  Bring it on!!</p>
<p>So many blessings and miracles and happiness for Amber (and us). God is Good.</p>

		<p>Amber just came out of the OR.  G-tube installation was successful, and almost all of the stitches/staples have been removed from her head (just a few left in place to keep things healing properly).  The feeding tube has also been removed from her nose, so there is nothing covering her beautiful face at all now.  She is just waking up as I type, and is smiling.  We will all be heading back to her room pretty soon.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the prayers, please keep &rsquo;em coming!!  But for today so far, we are looking good!</p>
