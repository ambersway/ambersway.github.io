We're going to make this journey in Amber's Way &ndash; with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</h2>

<p>As we have done every year for the past many years, today on Father&rsquo;s Day we went for a nice nature walk.&nbsp; We drove up past the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comstock's_Bridge">Comstock Covered Bridge</a> in Colchester, CT to a secluded parking area along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Line_State_Park_Trail">Airline Trail</a>, which is an old railroad line converted to a beautiful trail perfect for walking, running, and biking.</p>
<p>Knowing that Amber isn&rsquo;t quite ready for such a long walk, we dug out the old jogging stroller for her, which worked out well.&nbsp; In total, the family walked about a mile out on the trail, and a mile back, with a stop for snacks midway.&nbsp; It was sunny and hot, but enough shade all along to make it a wonderful way to spend the time.</p>
<p>Of course, thinking back to the 50 days spent in the hospital, and what we&rsquo;ve gone through over the past 3 months, I am very thankful to have my whole family with me today.&nbsp; But even more noteworthy for today was Amber&rsquo;s determination to get out of the stroller and walk.</p>
<p>The trail is very well maintained, but it is still a trail.&nbsp; Loose dirt and gravel is not nearly as level and stable as a wooden or linoleum floor.&nbsp; But Amber wanted to walk, and so she did.&nbsp; With nothing more than holding either my hand or Caron&rsquo;s hand, Amber walked about a mile of the trek, in two half-mile spurts with a break in between.&nbsp; Not even two months ago, Amber took <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/04/26/day-36-tiny-but-mighty-steps/">her first steps</a>&nbsp;after 36 days in the hospital, and was exhausted by a yard of walking.&nbsp; Now, she is up to a half-mile at a time!&nbsp; Yes, she is still working on her balance, but that too is getting better, as she walks around the house (with us hovering within inches) unassisted.&nbsp; This 6-year-old&rsquo;s determination is impressive!</p>
<p>And so I pray that her determination, her motivation continues.&nbsp; I pray for her left leg and foot, her left arm and hand to continue to regain their strength.&nbsp; I pray that she be cured of the cancer, that no tumors return, that there are no other developments that threaten her longevity.</p>
<p>But most of all, regardless of long-term outcome, I pray that God keeps her happy &mdash; just as she was today, holding my hand as I walked alongside her; as she put the effort, the focus into her journey today, one step at a time, and I provided her whatever support she needed on her way.</p>
<p>Yes, today&rsquo;s walk was rather symbolic for me.</p>

		<p>As Amber gets stronger and improves everyday I can&rsquo;t help but ponder (again) what the future holds for her.</p>
<p>This past month, although going great with Amber&rsquo;s positive improvements with things like walking on her own and &ldquo;lefty&rdquo; (which is her left arm, hand, and fingers) getting stronger, I can&rsquo;t help but feel sad.</p>
<p>About a month ago we suddenly lost our daycare provider at Saint Joseph School.&nbsp; A gentle soul of a woman who clearly cared for the children she was watching over.&nbsp; And then almost a week ago, we lost another wonderful woman whose grandchildren attend Saint Joseph School.&nbsp; This particular woman was diagnosed with an illness not unlike Amber&rsquo;s around the same time that we found out about Amber&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That was 3 months ago (in a few days &mdash; June 21st).&nbsp; The first woman was sudden, and the second, although not as &ldquo;sudden&rdquo;, was also too soon.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help but think about Amber in all this.&nbsp; What does this mean for her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid to think of what this means for Amber, given the type of cancer she has where the outlook is particularly grim.&nbsp; I guess it just puts life once again into perspective.&nbsp; <em>Cherish</em> it, <em>Enjoy</em> it . . .&nbsp; while we still can.&nbsp; Life is precious &mdash; which is making itself very clear to me, especially with the passing of these two wonderful women.&nbsp; I know it sounds so cliche to &ldquo;live life to the fullest&rdquo; but do we?&nbsp; With the mundane nuances of the &ldquo;same old same old&rdquo; day to day living, are we really living our life to the fullest?&nbsp; To actually remember that our life, and the lives of our loved ones around us, are not going to be here on Earth forever.&nbsp; To think that they actually may be gone tomorrow . . .&nbsp; that&rsquo;s a hard concept to digest and that&rsquo;s a hard concept to actually consciously think about, every . . . single . . . day . . .</p>
<p>Our own mortality.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it make life so much less complicated if we knew when our time was up?&nbsp; Well, for someone like Amber, with the type of cancer she has, hers might be predictable . . . but the doctors are working hard to change that, and&nbsp;we pray for Divine Intervention for her to be Blessed Stanley Rother&rsquo;s Miracle!&nbsp; I am optimistic for Amber but I am also realistic . . .</p>
<p>If you had a hard day, or a boring day, or even a great day today, give your loved ones an extra squeeze when you are hugging them and an &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, because remember, we never know when that may be our last one to give.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that a month ago on May 10th, we came home from the hospital!  Here it is June 10th (already) and it&rsquo;s getting to the point where our 50 long days of being in the hospital are beginning to take on that foggy distant memory type of feeling, fading a little bit more with each new day.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening we took the family to Holy Trinity Church in Hartford for Mass.  Holy Trinity is where Matt and I went weekly while Amber was in the hospital &mdash; a very much needed healing spot for the two of us to go and take a break, even if only for an hour, to be able to reflect, breathe, and refresh our souls during such a turbulent time in our lives.  Holy Trinity is <a href="http://ambersway.com/2018/03/30/father-charlie-a-blessed/">Father Charlie</a>&lsquo;s church, and while Amber has met Father Charlie in the hospital, she has not seen his church, and has been asking weekly to go and visit.  Father Charlie has not seen Amber out of her hospital bed, hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunity to see her talking or walking, and so we have been anticipating this visit for quite some time.  We were very excited to not only see Father Charlie but the parishioners as well because we knew that they have all been praying for Amber and our family.</p>
<p>Right before Mass, Father Charlie comes right over to see us, to see Amber, with a big hug for each of us.  He cannot take his eyes off Amber and keeps remarking about her being a miracle.  And then, during his sermon; talking about Veronica and Simon&rsquo;s aid to Jesus as he carried the Cross, he calls across the church &ldquo;Matt, Matt, would you be willing to tell us Amber&rsquo;s story, at the end of Mass?&rdquo;.  It occurred to us that this Church, this new part of our community, has helped us carry our Cross, and has helped Amber carry hers. Of course we would share the whole story with them.  And so, after Communion and before the Recessional Hymn, Father invited our whole family up to the front, and Matt had the opportunity to address the Church.  He talked about a few of our personal experiences, as well as emphasizing how hard it has been to accept that, as &ldquo;The Dad&rdquo;, he can&rsquo;t just fix this by just working harder or longer, and therefore has to put his faith in those that can fix this; in Amber&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s putting trust in the doctors, nurses, and the people around us, and having faith that God brought us to them for a reason.  Matt also made a point that you just don&rsquo;t know if you can lift 300 pounds until you try, and in the same way, we didn&rsquo;t know the strength of our faith until this test.</p>
<p>After applause and some tears, we headed back down to the pews where we finished Mass.  Before leaving, we had many of the parishioners come up to us with kinds words and hugs.  Holy Trinity has become a part of our community, our family in support of Amber &mdash; Our Church away from Church.</p>
<p>And after that, we said our farewell to Father Charlie and headed out for dinner at a spot we would often hit after Church, J&rsquo;s Restaurant &mdash; another thing we HAD to do now that we had Amber with us!  A celebration for sure!</p>
<p>It is so comforting to know that we have people cheering, praying, and rallying for Amber and our family.  Amber has her army behind her helping her fight this battle, and it&rsquo;s her battle that will be won, on her terms, in her way.</p>

		<p>Yesterday Amber had her first official Physical Therapy appointment since being in the hospital. Our new physical therapist&rsquo;s name is Elyce. As soon as we walked into her therapy room, Amber got excited because there, hanging in the middle of the room, was a swing! So while I caught Elyce up on Amber&rsquo;s sudden life changing situation, Amber got to swing.  Afterwards, Elyce had Amber on the floor rolling to get from point A to point B, which she did but it only lasted the one time because Amber&rsquo;s G-Tube button was sore.  Next Elyce had Amber pulling herself up to tall kneeling and then walking on her knees. Amber fell a couple times (on a mat) but got right back up and tried again. We ended up going over our session time with Elyce which I felt bad about but also, on the other hand, selfishly, I was glad it did because it was satisfying seeing Amber working so hard with a professional (in other words, not me trying to figure out what to do!).  And as an added bonus, at the end of the session, Elyce allowed us to borrow a square roller scooter to take home and practice for the week (which all of us have been thoroughly enjoying!).</p>
<p>Just as soon as we got home and I dropped Amber with her grandparents, I ran down to the school to help with decorating for the eighth grader&rsquo;s class night. Then I ran back home to grab Amber for radiation.  After radiation it was back home where both of the littlest ones went down for naps and I had just enough time do a couple things before getting Marie off the bus.  Shortly after that I ran to pick Brianna up from choir, helped her with her homework, got the littlest ones up from naps and made sure Marie was ready for Class Night, where she and her classmates were going to host the eighth graders.  My plan was to essentially just drop off Marie, only stopping briefly to say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; and then get the rest of the kids home for dinner than bed.  However, I was informed that I may want to hang around for the beginning part of the ceremony &mdash; which I am so glad we did!  Little did I know that after prayers and introductions, the eighth grade class got up and announced that this years year book was dedicated to Amber!   What a thoughtful and sweet gesture by the eighth grade class!  Our school, like Amber, may be small but man oh man, in the same vein, like Amber, boy is it <i><b>MIGHTY</b></i>!  A BIG Thank you to the eighth grade graduation class for the honor of dedicating your 2018 year book to Amber &mdash; that touched us immensely, and personally made my very long crazy day, much more special and worthwhile!</p>

		<p>Wow, what a busy day today!</p>
<p>We were out the door by 7:20 this morning, for a 7:45 radiation treatment.  Only 18 treatments left to go!  It&rsquo;s funny &ndash; as horrific as it is to have my 6-year old go through radiation treatments, the team at Backus is so nice, so good to Amber, so good to <i>us</i>, that it doesn&rsquo;t feel as bad as it should.  I guess that&rsquo;s a good thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s just the dichotomy that strikes me so much.</p>
<p>Then off to Children&rsquo;s Medical Center in Hartford for a 10:30 check-in.  By noon, Amber had her new g-tube in place, and had a couple dozen stiches removed from her scalp. All those <i>Stinkin&rsquo; Stiches</i>, as she liked to call them, are gone &ndash; and she is healing up really well.  Again, the contrast between the very visible healing of her scalp and the unknown of what the GBM may be doing inside her her head strikes me deeply.</p>
<p>And then, after sleeping off the sedation for almost 2 hours, we headed upstairs for a combo visit with Oncology and Nutrition.  Amber&rsquo;s weight is doing <i>very</i> well, so we are starting to cut down the supplemental overnight feed. Even after the sedation and procedure, Amber was asking for a snack, so there are definitely no appetite challenges there! And no changes with Oncology, continuing the course with radiation until the end of June.</p>
<p>So we continue with this new status quo, each step showing positive progress, taking progressive bites of the whale (with much of the elephant carcass now behind us), but knowing that we are far from out of the woods.  We pray to be shown that path out of the woods, no matter how many twists in that path, and no matter how often we stumble.</p>

		<p>Tomorrow is a big day, one that Amber&rsquo;s been looking forward to for quite a while &mdash; she&rsquo;s having her &ldquo;SS&rsquo;s&rdquo; removed; her &ldquo;Stinkin&rsquo; Stitches&rdquo;. She will also have her G-Tube replaced. And, we&rsquo;ll be meeting with Dr.Martin (NeuroSurg), Dr. Gillan (Oncology) and Dakota (Nutritionist). Big day indeed, especially with our day starting with an early trip to radiation.&nbsp; And after tomorrow&rsquo;s radiation visit, there will be &ldquo;only&rdquo; 18 more to go.</p>
<p>This past Friday we met with Michelle, Maura, and student McKenzie for OT.&nbsp; Right off the bat, Michelle and Maura immediately noticed how much looser Amber&rsquo;s left arm and hand were. They also couldn&rsquo;t believe how Amber&rsquo;s hand and fingers were loose and not in a tight fist.&nbsp; So any talk of having her wear a splint at night was now thrown out the window!&nbsp; The ladies were amazed at Amber&rsquo;s progress, but I wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; In my heart as they were assessing Amber and commenting on her positive progress, I just wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;shocked&rdquo;. Yes of course it&rsquo;s because Matt and I are helping Amber with some exercises, and yes it&rsquo;s Amber herself working hard, but it&rsquo;s <i>more</i> than that. It&rsquo;s <i>bigger</i> than that. It&rsquo;s all the healing prayers and healing thoughts for her.</p>
<p>When we got done with radiation on Friday and were walking back into the waiting area, a stranger started chatting with Amber and I.&nbsp; This simple pleasantry turned into something special and very generous for Amber.&nbsp; What this kind stranger did was something that touched my heart so deeply that I nearly lost it with a flood of tears.</p>
<p>What posses a complete stranger to do something spontaneous from the heart that is so sincere, guileless and unselfish?&nbsp; A bond.&nbsp; It was an instant unlikely bond between him and Amber; an older man that has lived almost all of his life and an innocent little girl that is just starting hers, yet both possibly doomed by the same uncompromising disease. A special bond that only a certain few share.&nbsp; Amber didn&rsquo;t see it but I did; a brief moment in time where both <em>beautiful</em> and <em>sad</em> collided.</p>
<p>To that kind stranger that is now a forever friend, thank you. Thank you for changing my life in more ways than you know.</p>

		<p>I guess it&rsquo;s safe to say that our family is in our &ldquo;New Normal&rdquo;.&nbsp; Amber is thriving and healing everyday.&nbsp; She is as determined as ever to get back to her normal, although it may be a slightly different version in some regards, for now.&nbsp; So rather than bore you with our &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; tidbits of our family life, <em>every day</em>, we would rather write when something major has/is/will be happening.&nbsp; Be sure though, Matt and I are not ending this blog &mdash; we&rsquo;ll just be posting less often than the daily routine we&rsquo;ve been maintaining.</p>
<p>If you want to continue following us, you may want to check out the &ldquo;Follow&rdquo; button (you should see it in the bottom right corner of this page) where you can enter your email address to automatically get an email when we post, instead of having to check in everyday.</p>
<p>We thank everyone who has taken the time to follow Amber during her journey &mdash; during the ups, the downs, and the in between.&nbsp; God has sent Amber on a journey and she is on the right path to finding her way, whatever way that may be.&nbsp; Matt, Marie, Brianna, Ryan, and I are going to make sure that we continue to walk her path, <em>her way,</em> with her as best as we can.&nbsp; Family and friends, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gotten us through this &mdash; truly our saving grace in so many ways.&nbsp; The support has been tremendous and greatly moving.&nbsp; Thank You.&nbsp; And so we ask if you could please continue to keep Amber in your daily thoughts and prayers.&nbsp; Amber&rsquo;s journey is far from over but the fact that we don&rsquo;t really have much to write about daily anymore, I think that speaks for itself and how far she&rsquo;s come!</p>
<p>So my friends, until next time &mdash; or at least, until the next time we have something interesting to say!</p>

		<p>A quiet holiday, recovering from the activity of yesterday. The weather cleared enough for the family to get out on the back deck to grill some hotdogs and hamburgers, and light off the fire pit for a while.  It was a good day.</p>
<p>Today we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedoms we enjoy.  Our prayers of thanks go to them today.</p>

		<p>Today was a big day &ndash; the Dance Recital! Brianna and Marie put on great performances with their groups. Brianna has been studying hip-hop this year, and Marie has been studying acro. I&rsquo;m very proud of both of them for sticking to the classes and rehearsals, getting up on stage in front of that audience, and doing so excellently. I might be a bit biased, but I think they were the best ones up there! And as a special treat, Caron and her sister-in-law Meg performed too, with their adult tap class! What a great show &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t be prouder of them too!</p>

<p>Today was also a somber reminder, as Amber should have been up there too for her ballet and tap numbers. But she had a good time, sitting with me in the audience. And a special thank you to the Luis Pabon Dance Arts Center, because at the end, Amber got to go up on stage and be part of the final bow, with all of the dancers and instructors. We appreciate all the support we&rsquo;ve received from LPDAC over the past couple months too &ndash; thank you so much.</p>
<p>Amber says she wants to get back up there on stage next year &ndash; so let&rsquo;s keep that motivation going and get her there!</p>

		<p>&hellip; and &ldquo;normal&rdquo; is a wonderful thing. While Caron and the older girls went off to their dress rehearsal for the upcoming dance recital, Amber and Ryan stayed home with me. A quiet day, eating lunch outside on the deck, and getting a little walking exercise with a trip down the driveway to get the mail. Ryan is a big help with Amber, making sure nothing is on the floor that she could trip on, getting her a drink, making sure she is comfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to fathom sometimes that the challenge in front of us is so huge, so critical. But, we have to just take one day at a time, and so having this kind of day is a beautiful thing. And we thank God for each day, and for all the people that are helping Amber &ndash; from the doctors and nurses, to those praying for her, to her little brother.</p>
