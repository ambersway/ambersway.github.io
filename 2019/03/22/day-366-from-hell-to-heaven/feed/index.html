	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way â€“ with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Caron and Matt, I speak of Amber, and think of your family, often throughout my days.  I wish you solace at this  time of remembering.  Love and faith are a powerful legacy for a sweet and strong little girl!  May her life and memory continue to be a blessing for you and for all whose lives she touched.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Caron and Matt Thank you for continuing to share yours and  Amber&#039;s Journey.  I am not sure I would have had the same level of Grace and Faith as you have both exemplified.  But I can tell you that reading this Blog have tremendously affected me for the positive.  I have been more conscientious of being appreciative of my children, wife and  and family.  And your Faith and Trust in God has renewed my views that love and faith will get us through.  You and your Family are amazing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Caron: I am an ACTS friend of Grandpa Mark.  Your heart-felt messages over the past year have always touched me deeply.  Then, I actually met you at Amber&#039;s wake and I heard you tell me of your personal faith in God (from your deeply loving position of Amber&#039;s mommy).  And now your message today has left me speechless, because I recognize the voice of God in your message today.  I have no doubt that Amber is so proud of you and that she is telling everyone about her great mommy as she travels throughout heaven these days.  You will be well known when you arrive at the golden gates someday.  I believe you will hear Christ say: &quot;Welcome my good and faithful servant&quot;.
You and your husband and your family have touched me -- I have grown better by knowing you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt and Caron,

It is hard to believe that a year has already gone by since Amber&#039;s journey from this world to heaven.  My heart goes out to you and your family as you relive this time.  It is inspiring that as you experience the grief of losing Amber, which has to be the hardest cross for any parent, you are still able to see beyond that with the grace of God.\, knowing that Amber is experiencing the awesome beauty of being with God in heaven. There is no doubt, Amber was and is, a super hero.  She found a way to bring about the positive in the midst of her illness with such grace.  She has certainly touched the lives of so many people.  I know that she has done that for me.  You have raised such beautiful children who will no doubt be a positive influence on all the people they will encounter in their lives as you are two beautiful role models for them.  Know that you are in my prayers daily as you travel this difficult but grace-filled journey.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Caron,  I learned of Ambers struggle from her grandfather Mark, an ACTS brother.  I was inspired by the families strength and faith in light of this terrible event.   
But your last entry was pure poetry explaining how Amber has impacted others and how you have maintained your faith in the view of tragedy.   
I have shared your family story as an example of keeping faith in time of unfathomable trouble. your faith is an awesome model for us all.  Thank you or sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Caron, Matt, and Family,

March 22nd is a special day in my life. When I heard of Amber&#039;s situation last year, well shoot it only seemed right to go to a Holy Hour on her behalf. Since then, I have prayed the beginning decade of the rosary for you all. This has been the longest, most spiritually fulfilling novena. Matt and yourself are such an inspiration to us all! Amber holds a special place in my heart, as does your family. You all will remain in my prayers on this day and all year long.  We will be reunited with Amber. Her smile, love, and spunkiness will live forever in our memories. God Bless you all.]]></description>
