	<description>A blog to record the journey of our 6 year old daughter Amber&#039;s progress, which began when she was rushed to the ER on March 22 2018 with a hemorrhaged tumor that caused a stroke, and the discovery that she has glioblastoma, a very aggressive form of brain cancer.  We&#039;re going to make this journey in Amber&#039;s Way ‚Äì with some spunk, a smirk, and a ton of hope and faith.</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Caron and Matt,

What a beautiful tradition to celebrate your children&#039;s half birthday,and why not for Amber?  She was certainly wise beyond her years.  She sees far beyond what adults can&#039;t see,that&#039;s for sure!.  What a beautiful child!!!  You will feel the hole in your heart for every birthday and every holiday; there&#039;s no getting away from that.  However, your beautiful and strong faith will certainly get you through the pain of all this as you travel on this difficult journey. The vision that your aunt had of Amber is not only amazing, but also comforting.  Knowing that Amber is with God in heaven experiencing all the joys that heaven brings is consolation in the midst of your sadness.  Please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers daily!   You are one beautiful and amazing family!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I now have another good reason to remember and honor Amber; her half birthday is my full birthday!  I look forward to remembering and honoring her on our shared day!  Forests burn and make way way for new life.  So too, the perfection that was your old life is gone.  But a new normal will emerge. There will always be a place and a hole in your heart to be filled with faith and with your sadness and your memories of the wonder that was/is Amber. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2665.png" alt="‚ô•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
